<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should I play the Roman fool, and die<br />
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes<br />
Do better upon them.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACDUFF</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn, hell-hound, turn!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all men else I have avoided thee:<br />
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged<br />
With blood of thine already.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no words:<br />
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain<br />
Than terms can give thee out!<br /></p>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou losest labour:<br />
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air<br />
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:<br />
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;<br />
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,<br />
To one of woman born.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despair thy charm;<br />
And let the angel whom thou still hast served<br />
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb<br />
Untimely ripp'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,<br />
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!<br />
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,<br />
That palter with us in a double sense;<br />
That keep the word of promise to our ear,<br />
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then yield thee, coward,<br />
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:<br />
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,<br />
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,<br />
'Here may you see the tyrant.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not yield,<br />
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,<br />
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.<br />
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,<br />
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,<br />
Yet I will try the last. Before my body<br />
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,<br />
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt, fighting. Alarums</em></p>
<p><em>Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM,
SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SIWARD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,<br />
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:<br />
He only lived but till he was a man;<br />
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd<br />
In the unshrinking station where he fought,<br />
But like a man he died.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SIWARD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he is dead?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow<br />
Must not be measured by his worth, for then<br />
It hath no end.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SIWARD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had he his hurts before?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, on the front.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SIWARD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why then, God's soldier be he!<br />
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,<br />
I would not wish them to a fairer death:<br />
And so, his knell is knoll'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He's worth more sorrow,<br />
And that I'll spend for him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SIWARD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He's worth no more<br />
They say he parted well, and paid his score:<br />
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands<br />
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:<br />
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,<br />
That speak my salutation in their minds;<br />
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:<br />
Hail, King of Scotland!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail, King of Scotland!<br /></p>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall not spend a large expense of time<br />
Before we reckon with your several loves,<br />
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,<br />
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland<br />
In such an honour named. What's more to do,<br />
Which would be planted newly with the time,<br />
As calling home our exiled friends abroad<br />
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;<br />
Producing forth the cruel ministers<br />
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,<br />
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands<br />
Took off her life; this, and what needful else<br />
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,<br />
We will perform in measure, time and place:<br />
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,<br />
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.<br /></p>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>
