Dunsinane.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX,
and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MENTEITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,<br />
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:<br />
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes<br />
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm<br />
Excite the mortified man.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANGUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Near Birnam wood<br />
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CAITHNESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file<br />
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,<br />
And many unrough youths that even now<br />
Protest their first of manhood.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MENTEITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does the tyrant?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CAITHNESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:<br />
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him<br />
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,<br />
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause<br />
Within the belt of rule.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANGUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now does he feel<br />
His secret murders sticking on his hands;<br />
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;<br />
Those he commands move only in command,<br />
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title<br />
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe<br />
Upon a dwarfish thief.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MENTEITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who then shall blame<br />
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,<br />
When all that is within him does condemn<br />
Itself for being there?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CAITHNESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, march we on,<br />
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:<br />
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,<br />
And with him pour we in our country's purge<br />
Each drop of us.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or so much as it needs,<br />
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.<br />
Make we our march towards Birnam.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt, marching</em></p>
