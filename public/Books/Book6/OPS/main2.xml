<blockquote>
<p><em>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where hast thou been, sister?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Killing swine.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister, where thou?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,<br />
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:—<br />
'Give me,' quoth I:<br />
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.<br />
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:<br />
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,<br />
And, like a rat without a tail,<br />
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll give thee a wind.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou'rt kind.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I another.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I myself have all the other,<br />
And the very ports they blow,<br />
All the quarters that they know<br />
I' the shipman's card.<br />
I will drain him dry as hay:<br />
Sleep shall neither night nor day<br />
Hang upon his pent-house lid;<br />
He shall live a man forbid:<br />
Weary se'nnights nine times nine<br />
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:<br />
Though his bark cannot be lost,<br />
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.<br />
Look what I have.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show me, show me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here I have a pilot's thumb,<br />
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.<br /></p>
<p><em>Drum within</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A drum, a drum!<br />
Macbeth doth come.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weird sisters, hand in hand,<br />
Posters of the sea and land,<br />
Thus do go about, about:<br />
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine<br />
And thrice again, to make up nine.<br />
Peace! the charm's wound up.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these<br />
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,<br />
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,<br />
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught<br />
That man may question? You seem to understand me,<br />
By each at once her chappy finger laying<br />
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,<br />
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<br />
That you are so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak, if you can: what are you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear<br />
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,<br />
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed<br />
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner<br />
You greet with present grace and great prediction<br />
Of noble having and of royal hope,<br />
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.<br />
If you can look into the seeds of time,<br />
And say which grain will grow and which will not,<br />
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear<br />
Your favours nor your hate.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so happy, yet much happier.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:<br />
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:<br />
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;<br />
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,<br />
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king<br />
Stands not within the prospect of belief,<br />
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence<br />
You owe this strange intelligence? or why<br />
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way<br />
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.<br /></p>
<p><em>Witches vanish</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,<br />
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted<br />
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were such things here as we do speak about?<br />
Or have we eaten on the insane root<br />
That takes the reason prisoner?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your children shall be kings.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall be king.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter ROSS and ANGUS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,<br />
The news of thy success; and when he reads<br />
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,<br />
His wonders and his praises do contend<br />
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,<br />
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,<br />
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,<br />
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,<br />
Strange images of death. As thick as hail<br />
Came post with post; and every one did bear<br />
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,<br />
And pour'd them down before him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANGUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are sent<br />
To give thee from our royal master thanks;<br />
Only to herald thee into his sight,<br />
Not pay thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,<br />
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:<br />
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!<br />
For it is thine.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, can the devil speak true?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me<br />
In borrow'd robes?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANGUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who was the thane lives yet;<br />
But under heavy judgment bears that life<br />
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined<br />
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel<br />
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both<br />
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;<br />
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,<br />
Have overthrown him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!<br />
The greatest is behind.<br /></p>
<p><em>To ROSS and ANGUS</em></p>
<p>Thanks for your pains.<br /></p>
<p><em>To BANQUO</em></p>
<p>Do you not hope your children shall be kings,<br />
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me<br />
Promised no less to them?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That trusted home<br />
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,<br />
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:<br />
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<br />
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<br />
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's<br />
In deepest consequence.<br />
Cousins, a word, I pray you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] Two truths are told,<br />
As happy prologues to the swelling act<br />
Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.<br /></p>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<p>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,<br />
Why hath it given me earnest of success,<br />
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:<br />
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion<br />
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair<br />
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<br />
Against the use of nature? Present fears<br />
Are less than horrible imaginings:<br />
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,<br />
Shakes so my single state of man that function<br />
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is<br />
But what is not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, how our partner's rapt.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown
me,<br />
Without my stir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New horrors come upon him,<br />
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould<br />
But with the aid of use.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] Come what come may,<br />
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought<br />
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains<br />
Are register'd where every day I turn<br />
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.<br />
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,<br />
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak<br />
Our free hearts each to other.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very gladly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Till then, enough. Come, friends.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
