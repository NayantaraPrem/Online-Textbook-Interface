<blockquote>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and
Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not<br />
Those in commission yet return'd?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My liege,<br />
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke<br />
With one that saw him die: who did report<br />
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,<br />
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth<br />
A deep repentance: nothing in his life<br />
Became him like the leaving it; he died<br />
As one that had been studied in his death<br />
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,<br />
As 'twere a careless trifle.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no art<br />
To find the mind's construction in the face:<br />
He was a gentleman on whom I built<br />
An absolute trust.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS</em></p>
<p>O worthiest cousin!<br />
The sin of my ingratitude even now<br />
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before<br />
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow<br />
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,<br />
That the proportion both of thanks and payment<br />
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,<br />
More is thy due than more than all can pay.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The service and the loyalty I owe,<br />
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part<br />
Is to receive our duties; and our duties<br />
Are to your throne and state children and servants,<br />
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing<br />
Safe toward your love and honour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome hither:<br />
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour<br />
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,<br />
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known<br />
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee<br />
And hold thee to my heart.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There if I grow,<br />
The harvest is your own.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My plenteous joys,<br />
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves<br />
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,<br />
And you whose places are the nearest, know<br />
We will establish our estate upon<br />
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter<br />
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must<br />
Not unaccompanied invest him only,<br />
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine<br />
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,<br />
And bind us further to you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rest is labour, which is not used for you:<br />
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful<br />
The hearing of my wife with your approach;<br />
So humbly take my leave.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My worthy Cawdor!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step<br />
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,<br />
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;<br />
Let not light see my black and deep desires:<br />
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,<br />
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,<br />
And in his commendations I am fed;<br />
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,<br />
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:<br />
It is a peerless kinsman.<br /></p>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>
