<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive<br />
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen<br />
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon<br />
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,<br />
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again<br />
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once<br />
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of<br />
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her<br />
walking and other actual performances, what, at any<br />
time, have you heard her say?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That, sir, which I will not report after her.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to<br />
confirm my speech.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</em></p>
<p>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;<br />
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How came she by that light?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, it stood by her: she has light by her<br />
continually; 'tis her command.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, her eyes are open.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, but their sense is shut.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus<br />
washing her hands: I have known her continue in<br />
this a quarter of an hour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet here's a spot.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from<br />
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out, damned spot! out, I say!—One: two: why,<br />
then, 'tis time to do't.—Hell is murky!—Fie, my<br />
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we<br />
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to<br />
account?—Yet who would have thought the old man<br />
to have had so much blood in him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you mark that?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?—<br />
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o'<br />
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with<br />
this starting.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of<br />
that: heaven knows what she has known.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the<br />
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little<br />
hand. Oh, oh, oh!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the<br />
dignity of the whole body.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, well, well,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pray God it be, sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known<br />
those which have walked in their sleep who have died<br />
holily in their beds.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so<br />
pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he<br />
cannot come out on's grave.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:<br />
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's<br />
done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will she go now to bed?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds<br />
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds<br />
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:<br />
More needs she the divine than the physician.<br />
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;<br />
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,<br />
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:<br />
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.<br />
I think, but dare not speak.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good night, good doctor.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
