<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<br />
Which can interpret further: only, I say,<br />
Things have been strangely borne. The<br />
gracious Duncan<br />
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:<br />
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;<br />
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,<br />
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.<br />
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous<br />
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<br />
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<br />
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight<br />
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,<br />
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br />
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<br />
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive<br />
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,<br />
He has borne all things well: and I do think<br />
That had he Duncan's sons under his key—<br />
As, an't please heaven, he shall not—they<br />
should find<br />
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br />
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd<br />
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear<br />
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell<br />
Where he bestows himself?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The son of Duncan,<br />
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth<br />
Lives in the English court, and is received<br />
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br />
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<br />
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff<br />
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br />
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:<br />
That, by the help of these—with Him above<br />
To ratify the work—we may again<br />
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,<br />
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<br />
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:<br />
All which we pine for now: and this report<br />
Hath so exasperate the king that he<br />
Prepares for some attempt of war.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sent he to Macduff?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'<br />
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,<br />
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time<br />
That clogs me with this answer.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that well might<br />
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance<br />
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel<br />
Fly to the court of England and unfold<br />
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing<br />
May soon return to this our suffering country<br />
Under a hand accursed!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll send my prayers with him.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
