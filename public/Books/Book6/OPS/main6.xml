<blockquote>
<p><em>Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants
with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter
MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well<br />
It were done quickly: if the assassination<br />
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<br />
With his surcease success; that but this blow<br />
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,<br />
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,<br />
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases<br />
We still have judgment here; that we but teach<br />
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<br />
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice<br />
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice<br />
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;<br />
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,<br />
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,<br />
Who should against his murderer shut the door,<br />
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan<br />
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<br />
So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br />
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<br />
The deep damnation of his taking-off;<br />
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,<br />
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed<br />
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,<br />
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,<br />
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur<br />
To prick the sides of my intent, but only<br />
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself<br />
And falls on the other.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
<p>How now! what news?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath he ask'd for me?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know you not he has?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will proceed no further in this business:<br />
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought<br />
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,<br />
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,<br />
Not cast aside so soon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was the hope drunk<br />
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?<br />
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale<br />
At what it did so freely? From this time<br />
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard<br />
To be the same in thine own act and valour<br />
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that<br />
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,<br />
And live a coward in thine own esteem,<br />
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'<br />
Like the poor cat i' the adage?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prithee, peace:<br />
I dare do all that may become a man;<br />
Who dares do more is none.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What beast was't, then,<br />
That made you break this enterprise to me?<br />
When you durst do it, then you were a man;<br />
And, to be more than what you were, you would<br />
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place<br />
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:<br />
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now<br />
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know<br />
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:<br />
I would, while it was smiling in my face,<br />
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,<br />
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you<br />
Have done to this.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we should fail?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We fail!<br />
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,<br />
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep—<br />
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey<br />
Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains<br />
Will I with wine and wassail so convince<br />
That memory, the warder of the brain,<br />
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason<br />
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep<br />
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,<br />
What cannot you and I perform upon<br />
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon<br />
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt<br />
Of our great quell?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring forth men-children only;<br />
For thy undaunted mettle should compose<br />
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,<br />
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two<br />
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,<br />
That they have done't?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who dares receive it other,<br />
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar<br />
Upon his death?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am settled, and bend up<br />
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.<br />
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:<br />
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
