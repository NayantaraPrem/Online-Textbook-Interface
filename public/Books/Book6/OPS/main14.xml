<blockquote>
<p><em>A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS,
LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know your own degrees; sit down: at first<br />
And last the hearty welcome.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lords</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your majesty.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ourself will mingle with society,<br />
And play the humble host.<br />
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time<br />
We will require her welcome.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;<br />
For my heart speaks they are welcome.<br /></p>
<p><em>First Murderer appears at the door</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.<br />
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:<br />
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure<br />
The table round.<br /></p>
<p><em>Approaching the door</em></p>
<p>There's blood on thy face.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis Banquo's then.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis better thee without than he within.<br />
Is he dispatch'd?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good<br />
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,<br />
Thou art the nonpareil.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most royal sir,<br />
Fleance is 'scaped.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,<br />
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,<br />
As broad and general as the casing air:<br />
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in<br />
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,<br />
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;<br />
The least a death to nature.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for that:<br />
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled<br />
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,<br />
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow<br />
We'll hear, ourselves, again.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Murderer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My royal lord,<br />
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold<br />
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,<br />
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;<br />
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;<br />
Meeting were bare without it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet remembrancer!<br />
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,<br />
And health on both!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May't please your highness sit.<br /></p>
<p><em>The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's
place</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,<br />
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;<br />
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness<br />
Than pity for mischance!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His absence, sir,<br />
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness<br />
To grace us with your royal company.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The table's full.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a place reserved, sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your
highness?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of you have done this?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lords</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, my good lord?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou canst not say I did it: never shake<br />
Thy gory locks at me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,<br />
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;<br />
The fit is momentary; upon a thought<br />
He will again be well: if much you note him,<br />
You shall offend him and extend his passion:<br />
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that<br />
Which might appal the devil.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O proper stuff!<br />
This is the very painting of your fear:<br />
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,<br />
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,<br />
Impostors to true fear, would well become<br />
A woman's story at a winter's fire,<br />
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!<br />
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,<br />
You look but on a stool.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!<br />
how say you?<br />
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.<br />
If charnel-houses and our graves must send<br />
Those that we bury back, our monuments<br />
Shall be the maws of kites.<br /></p>
<p><em>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, quite unmann'd in folly?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I stand here, I saw him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fie, for shame!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,<br />
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;<br />
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd<br />
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,<br />
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,<br />
And there an end; but now they rise again,<br />
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,<br />
And push us from our stools: this is more strange<br />
Than such a murder is.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My worthy lord,<br />
Your noble friends do lack you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do forget.<br />
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,<br />
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing<br />
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;<br />
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.<br />
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,<br />
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;<br />
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,<br />
And all to all.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lords</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our duties, and the pledge.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!<br />
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;<br />
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes<br />
Which thou dost glare with!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of this, good peers,<br />
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;<br />
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What man dare, I dare:<br />
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,<br />
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;<br />
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves<br />
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,<br />
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;<br />
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me<br />
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!<br />
Unreal mockery, hence!<br /></p>
<p><em>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</em></p>
<p>Why, so: being gone,<br />
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,<br />
With most admired disorder.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can such things be,<br />
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,<br />
Without our special wonder? You make me strange<br />
Even to the disposition that I owe,<br />
When now I think you can behold such sights,<br />
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,<br />
When mine is blanched with fear.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What sights, my lord?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;<br />
Question enrages him. At once, good night:<br />
Stand not upon the order of your going,<br />
But go at once.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good night; and better health<br />
Attend his majesty!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A kind good night to all!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:<br />
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;<br />
Augurs and understood relations have<br />
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth<br />
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost at odds with morning, which is which.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person<br />
At our great bidding?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you send to him, sir?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hear it by the way; but I will send:<br />
There's not a one of them but in his house<br />
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,<br />
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:<br />
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,<br />
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,<br />
All causes shall give way: I am in blood<br />
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,<br />
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:<br />
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;<br />
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You lack the season of all natures, sleep.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse<br />
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:<br />
We are yet but young in deed.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
