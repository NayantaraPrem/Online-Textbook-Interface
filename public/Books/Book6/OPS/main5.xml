<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,
BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air<br />
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself<br />
Unto our gentle senses.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guest of summer,<br />
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,<br />
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath<br />
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,<br />
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird<br />
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:<br />
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,<br />
The air is delicate.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, see, our honour'd hostess!<br />
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,<br />
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you<br />
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,<br />
And thank us for your trouble.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All our service<br />
In every point twice done and then done double<br />
Were poor and single business to contend<br />
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith<br />
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,<br />
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,<br />
We rest your hermits.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where's the thane of Cawdor?<br />
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose<br />
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;<br />
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him<br />
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,<br />
We are your guest to-night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your servants ever<br />
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,<br />
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,<br />
Still to return your own.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me your hand;<br />
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,<br />
And shall continue our graces towards him.<br />
By your leave, hostess.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
