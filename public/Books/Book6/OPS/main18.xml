<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What had he done, to make him fly the land?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must have patience, madam.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had none:<br />
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,<br />
Our fears do make us traitors.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know not<br />
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,<br />
His mansion and his titles in a place<br />
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;<br />
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,<br />
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,<br />
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.<br />
All is the fear and nothing is the love;<br />
As little is the wisdom, where the flight<br />
So runs against all reason.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dearest coz,<br />
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,<br />
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows<br />
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak<br />
much further;<br />
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors<br />
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour<br />
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,<br />
But float upon a wild and violent sea<br />
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:<br />
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:<br />
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward<br />
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,<br />
Blessing upon you!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,<br />
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:<br />
I take my leave at once.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sirrah, your father's dead;<br />
And what will you do now? How will you live?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As birds do, mother.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, with worms and flies?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With what I get, I mean; and so do they.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,<br />
The pitfall nor the gin.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.<br />
My father is not dead, for all your saying.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, how will you do for a husband?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,<br />
With wit enough for thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was my father a traitor, mother?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, that he was.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a traitor?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, one that swears and lies.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And be all traitors that do so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be
hanged.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who must hang them?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, the honest men.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the liars and swearers are fools,<br />
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat<br />
the honest men and hang up them.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, God help thee, poor monkey!<br />
But how wilt thou do for a father?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he were dead, you'ld weep for<br />
him: if you would not, it were a good sign<br />
that I should quickly have a new father.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,<br />
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.<br />
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:<br />
If you will take a homely man's advice,<br />
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.<br />
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;<br />
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,<br />
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!<br />
I dare abide no longer.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whither should I fly?<br />
I have done no harm. But I remember now<br />
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm<br />
Is often laudable, to do good sometime<br />
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,<br />
Do I put up that womanly defence,<br />
To say I have done no harm?<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Murderers</em></p>
<p>What are these faces?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is your husband?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope, in no place so unsanctified<br />
Where such as thou mayst find him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He's a traitor.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, you egg!<br /></p>
<p><em>Stabbing him</em></p>
<p>Young fry of treachery!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Son</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has kill'd me, mother:<br />
Run away, I pray you!<br /></p>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
<p><em>Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers,
following her</em></p>
