<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there<br />
Weep our sad bosoms empty.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us rather<br />
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men<br />
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn<br />
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows<br />
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds<br />
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out<br />
Like syllable of dolour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I believe I'll wail,<br />
What know believe, and what I can redress,<br />
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.<br />
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.<br />
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<br />
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.<br />
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;<br />
but something<br />
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom<br />
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb<br />
To appease an angry god.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not treacherous.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Macbeth is.<br />
A good and virtuous nature may recoil<br />
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave<br />
your pardon;<br />
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:<br />
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;<br />
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<br />
Yet grace must still look so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have lost my hopes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.<br />
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,<br />
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,<br />
Without leave-taking? I pray you,<br />
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,<br />
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,<br />
Whatever I shall think.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bleed, bleed, poor country!<br />
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,<br />
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou<br />
thy wrongs;<br />
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:<br />
I would not be the villain that thou think'st<br />
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,<br />
And the rich East to boot.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be not offended:<br />
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<br />
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;<br />
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash<br />
Is added to her wounds: I think withal<br />
There would be hands uplifted in my right;<br />
And here from gracious England have I offer<br />
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<br />
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,<br />
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country<br />
Shall have more vices than it had before,<br />
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,<br />
By him that shall succeed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What should he be?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is myself I mean: in whom I know<br />
All the particulars of vice so grafted<br />
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth<br />
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state<br />
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared<br />
With my confineless harms.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not in the legions<br />
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd<br />
In evils to top Macbeth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grant him bloody,<br />
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br />
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br />
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,<br />
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br />
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />
The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />
All continent impediments would o'erbear<br />
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth<br />
Than such an one to reign.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boundless intemperance<br />
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<br />
The untimely emptying of the happy throne<br />
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<br />
To take upon you what is yours: you may<br />
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br />
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.<br />
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be<br />
That vulture in you, to devour so many<br />
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<br />
Finding it so inclined.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this there grows<br />
In my most ill-composed affection such<br />
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,<br />
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,<br />
Desire his jewels and this other's house:<br />
And my more-having would be as a sauce<br />
To make me hunger more; that I should forge<br />
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<br />
Destroying them for wealth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This avarice<br />
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root<br />
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been<br />
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<br />
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.<br />
Of your mere own: all these are portable,<br />
With other graces weigh'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<br />
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,<br />
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<br />
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<br />
I have no relish of them, but abound<br />
In the division of each several crime,<br />
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<br />
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<br />
Uproar the universal peace, confound<br />
All unity on earth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Scotland, Scotland!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<br />
I am as I have spoken.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fit to govern!<br />
No, not to live. O nation miserable,<br />
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,<br />
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<br />
Since that the truest issue of thy throne<br />
By his own interdiction stands accursed,<br />
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<br />
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,<br />
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,<br />
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<br />
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself<br />
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,<br />
Thy hope ends here!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macduff, this noble passion,<br />
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br />
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts<br />
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br />
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br />
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br />
From over-credulous haste: but God above<br />
Deal between thee and me! for even now<br />
I put myself to thy direction, and<br />
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure<br />
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br />
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br />
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,<br />
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,<br />
At no time broke my faith, would not betray<br />
The devil to his fellow and delight<br />
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br />
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,<br />
Is thine and my poor country's to command:<br />
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,<br />
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br />
Already at a point, was setting forth.<br />
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness<br />
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<br />
'Tis hard to reconcile.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter a Doctor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well; more anon.—Comes the king forth, I pray you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls<br />
That stay his cure: their malady convinces<br />
The great assay of art; but at his touch—<br />
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand—<br />
They presently amend.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank you, doctor.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Doctor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the disease he means?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis call'd the evil:<br />
A most miraculous work in this good king;<br />
Which often, since my here-remain in England,<br />
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,<br />
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,<br />
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,<br />
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,<br />
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,<br />
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,<br />
To the succeeding royalty he leaves<br />
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,<br />
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,<br />
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,<br />
That speak him full of grace.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, who comes here?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My countryman; but yet I know him not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know him now. Good God, betimes remove<br />
The means that makes us strangers!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, amen.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stands Scotland where it did?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas, poor country!<br />
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot<br />
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,<br />
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;<br />
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air<br />
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems<br />
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell<br />
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives<br />
Expire before the flowers in their caps,<br />
Dying or ere they sicken.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, relation<br />
Too nice, and yet too true!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the newest grief?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:<br />
Each minute teems a new one.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does my wife?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, well.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And all my children?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well too.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I came hither to transport the tidings,<br />
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<br />
Of many worthy fellows that were out;<br />
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,<br />
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:<br />
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland<br />
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<br />
To doff their dire distresses.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be't their comfort<br />
We are coming thither: gracious England hath<br />
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<br />
An older and a better soldier none<br />
That Christendom gives out.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would I could answer<br />
This comfort with the like! But I have words<br />
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,<br />
Where hearing should not latch them.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What concern they?<br />
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<br />
Due to some single breast?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mind that's honest<br />
But in it shares some woe; though the main part<br />
Pertains to you alone.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it be mine,<br />
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<br />
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<br />
That ever yet they heard.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum! I guess at it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes<br />
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,<br />
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,<br />
To add the death of you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merciful heaven!<br />
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;<br />
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak<br />
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My children too?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wife, children, servants, all<br />
That could be found.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I must be from thence!<br />
My wife kill'd too?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have said.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be comforted:<br />
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,<br />
To cure this deadly grief.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has no children. All my pretty ones?<br />
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?<br />
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<br />
At one fell swoop?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dispute it like a man.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall do so;<br />
But I must also feel it as a man:<br />
I cannot but remember such things were,<br />
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,<br />
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<br />
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,<br />
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<br />
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief<br />
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes<br />
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,<br />
Cut short all intermission; front to front<br />
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<br />
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,<br />
Heaven forgive him too!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tune goes manly.<br />
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;<br />
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth<br />
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<br />
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:<br />
The night is long that never finds the day.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
