<blockquote>
<p><em>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Round about the cauldron go;<br />
In the poison'd entrails throw.<br />
Toad, that under cold stone<br />
Days and nights has thirty-one<br />
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,<br />
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double, double toil and trouble;<br />
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fillet of a fenny snake,<br />
In the cauldron boil and bake;<br />
Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br />
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br />
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<br />
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,<br />
For a charm of powerful trouble,<br />
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double, double toil and trouble;<br />
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br />
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf<br />
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,<br />
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,<br />
Liver of blaspheming Jew,<br />
Gall of goat, and slips of yew<br />
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,<br />
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,<br />
Finger of birth-strangled babe<br />
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,<br />
Make the gruel thick and slab:<br />
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,<br />
For the ingredients of our cauldron.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double, double toil and trouble;<br />
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool it with a baboon's blood,<br />
Then the charm is firm and good.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter HECATE to the other three Witches</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HECATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O well done! I commend your pains;<br />
And every one shall share i' the gains;<br />
And now about the cauldron sing,<br />
Live elves and fairies in a ring,<br />
Enchanting all that you put in.<br /></p>
<p><em>Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' &amp; c</em></p>
<p><em>HECATE retires</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the pricking of my thumbs,<br />
Something wicked this way comes.<br />
Open, locks,<br />
Whoever knocks!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!<br />
What is't you do?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deed without a name.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I conjure you, by that which you profess,<br />
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:<br />
Though you untie the winds and let them fight<br />
Against the churches; though the yesty waves<br />
Confound and swallow navigation up;<br />
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;<br />
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;<br />
Though palaces and pyramids do slope<br />
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure<br />
Of nature's germens tumble all together,<br />
Even till destruction sicken; answer me<br />
To what I ask you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demand.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We'll answer.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,<br />
Or from our masters?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call 'em; let me see 'em.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten<br />
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten<br />
From the murderer's gibbet throw<br />
Into the flame.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, high or low;<br />
Thyself and office deftly show!<br /></p>
<p><em>Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell me, thou unknown power,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He knows thy thought:<br />
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Apparition</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;<br />
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.<br /></p>
<p><em>Descends</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;<br />
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one<br />
word more,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He will not be commanded: here's another,<br />
More potent than the first.<br /></p>
<p><em>Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Apparition</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Apparition</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn<br />
The power of man, for none of woman born<br />
Shall harm Macbeth.<br /></p>
<p><em>Descends</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?<br />
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,<br />
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;<br />
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,<br />
And sleep in spite of thunder.<br /></p>
<p><em>Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in
his hand</em></p>
<p>What is this<br />
That rises like the issue of a king,<br />
And wears upon his baby-brow the round<br />
And top of sovereignty?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen, but speak not to't.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Apparition</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care<br />
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:<br />
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until<br />
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill<br />
Shall come against him.<br /></p>
<p><em>Descends</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That will never be<br />
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree<br />
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!<br />
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood<br />
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth<br />
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath<br />
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart<br />
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art<br />
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever<br />
Reign in this kingdom?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seek to know no more.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be satisfied: deny me this,<br />
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.<br />
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?<br /></p>
<p><em>Hautboys</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Third Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;<br />
Come like shadows, so depart!<br /></p>
<p><em>A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
GHOST OF BANQUO following</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!<br />
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,<br />
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.<br />
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!<br />
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!<br />
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?<br />
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:<br />
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass<br />
Which shows me many more; and some I see<br />
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:<br />
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;<br />
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,<br />
And points at them for his.<br /></p>
<p><em>Apparitions vanish</em></p>
<p>What, is this so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, sir, all this is so: but why<br />
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?<br />
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,<br />
And show the best of our delights:<br />
I'll charm the air to give a sound,<br />
While you perform your antic round:<br />
That this great king may kindly say,<br />
Our duties did his welcome pay.<br /></p>
<p><em>Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with
HECATE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour<br />
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!<br />
Come in, without there!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LENNOX</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's your grace's will?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saw you the weird sisters?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Came they not by you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, indeed, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infected be the air whereon they ride;<br />
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear<br />
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word<br />
Macduff is fled to England.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fled to England!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:<br />
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook<br />
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment<br />
The very firstlings of my heart shall be<br />
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,<br />
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:<br />
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;<br />
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword<br />
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls<br />
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;<br />
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.<br />
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?<br />
Come, bring me where they are.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
