<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter BANQUO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,<br />
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,<br />
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said<br />
It should not stand in thy posterity,<br />
But that myself should be the root and father<br />
Of many kings. If there come truth from them—<br />
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine—<br />
Why, by the verities on thee made good,<br />
May they not be my oracles as well,<br />
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.<br /></p>
<p><em>Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as
queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's our chief guest.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he had been forgotten,<br />
It had been as a gap in our great feast,<br />
And all-thing unbecoming.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,<br />
And I'll request your presence.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your highness<br />
Command upon me; to the which my duties<br />
Are with a most indissoluble tie<br />
For ever knit.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ride you this afternoon?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should have else desired your good advice,<br />
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,<br />
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.<br />
Is't far you ride?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far, my lord, as will fill up the time<br />
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,<br />
I must become a borrower of the night<br />
For a dark hour or twain.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail not our feast.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, I will not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd<br />
In England and in Ireland, not confessing<br />
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers<br />
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,<br />
When therewithal we shall have cause of state<br />
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,<br />
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;<br />
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit BANQUO</em></p>
<p>Let every man be master of his time<br />
Till seven at night: to make society<br />
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself<br />
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant</em></p>
<p>Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men<br />
Our pleasure?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ATTENDANT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are, my lord, without the palace gate.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring them before us.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
<p>To be thus is nothing;<br />
But to be safely thus.—Our fears in Banquo<br />
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<br />
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;<br />
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<br />
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<br />
To act in safety. There is none but he<br />
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<br />
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,<br />
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<br />
When first they put the name of king upon me,<br />
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<br />
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:<br />
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br />
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br />
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,<br />
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,<br />
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;<br />
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;<br />
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<br />
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<br />
Given to the common enemy of man,<br />
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<br />
Rather than so, come fate into the list.<br />
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers</em></p>
<p>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
<p>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was, so please your highness.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well then, now<br />
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know<br />
That it was he in the times past which held you<br />
So under fortune, which you thought had been<br />
Our innocent self: this I made good to you<br />
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,<br />
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,<br />
the instruments,<br />
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might<br />
To half a soul and to a notion crazed<br />
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You made it known to us.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did so, and went further, which is now<br />
Our point of second meeting. Do you find<br />
Your patience so predominant in your nature<br />
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd<br />
To pray for this good man and for his issue,<br />
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave<br />
And beggar'd yours for ever?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are men, my liege.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;<br />
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<br />
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept<br />
All by the name of dogs: the valued file<br />
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,<br />
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one<br />
According to the gift which bounteous nature<br />
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive<br />
Particular addition. from the bill<br />
That writes them all alike: and so of men.<br />
Now, if you have a station in the file,<br />
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;<br />
And I will put that business in your bosoms,<br />
Whose execution takes your enemy off,<br />
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,<br />
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,<br />
Which in his death were perfect.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am one, my liege,<br />
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<br />
Have so incensed that I am reckless what<br />
I do to spite the world.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I another<br />
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,<br />
That I would set my lie on any chance,<br />
To mend it, or be rid on't.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both of you<br />
Know Banquo was your enemy.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Both Murderers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>True, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,<br />
That every minute of his being thrusts<br />
Against my near'st of life: and though I could<br />
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight<br />
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,<br />
For certain friends that are both his and mine,<br />
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall<br />
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,<br />
That I to your assistance do make love,<br />
Masking the business from the common eye<br />
For sundry weighty reasons.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall, my lord,<br />
Perform what you command us.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Murderer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though our lives—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most<br />
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;<br />
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,<br />
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,<br />
And something from the palace; always thought<br />
That I require a clearness: and with him—<br />
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—<br />
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,<br />
Whose absence is no less material to me<br />
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate<br />
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:<br />
I'll come to you anon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Both Murderers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are resolved, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll call upon you straight: abide within.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt Murderers</em></p>
<p>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,<br />
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
