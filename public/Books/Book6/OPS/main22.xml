<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:<br />
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,<br />
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?<br />
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know<br />
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:<br />
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman<br />
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,<br />
false thanes,<br />
And mingle with the English epicures:<br />
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear<br />
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
<p>The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!<br />
Where got'st thou that goose look?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Servant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is ten thousand—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geese, villain!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Servant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soldiers, sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,<br />
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?<br />
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine<br />
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Servant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The English force, so please you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take thy face hence.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<p>Seyton!—I am sick at heart,<br />
When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push<br />
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.<br />
I have lived long enough: my way of life<br />
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;<br />
And that which should accompany old age,<br />
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,<br />
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,<br />
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,<br />
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
Seyton!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter SEYTON</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SEYTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your gracious pleasure?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What news more?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SEYTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.<br />
Give me my armour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SEYTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis not needed yet.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll put it on.<br />
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;<br />
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.<br />
How does your patient, doctor?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so sick, my lord,<br />
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,<br />
That keep her from her rest.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cure her of that.<br />
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,<br />
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,<br />
Raze out the written troubles of the brain<br />
And with some sweet oblivious antidote<br />
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff<br />
Which weighs upon the heart?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therein the patient<br />
Must minister to himself.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.<br />
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.<br />
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.<br />
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast<br />
The water of my land, find her disease,<br />
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,<br />
I would applaud thee to the very echo,<br />
That should applaud again.—Pull't off, I say.—<br />
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,<br />
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation<br />
Makes us hear something.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring it after me.<br />
I will not be afraid of death and bane,<br />
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,<br />
Profit again should hardly draw me here.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
