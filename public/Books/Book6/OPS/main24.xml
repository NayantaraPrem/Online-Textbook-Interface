castle.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and
colours</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang out our banners on the outward walls;<br />
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength<br />
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie<br />
Till famine and the ague eat them up:<br />
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,<br />
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,<br />
And beat them backward home.<br /></p>
<p><em>A cry of women within</em></p>
<p>What is that noise?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SEYTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the cry of women, my good lord.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have almost forgot the taste of fears;<br />
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd<br />
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair<br />
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir<br />
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;<br />
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts<br />
Cannot once start me.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter SEYTON</em></p>
<p>Wherefore was that cry?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SEYTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The queen, my lord, is dead.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She should have died hereafter;<br />
There would have been a time for such a word.<br />
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br />
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<br />
To the last syllable of recorded time,<br />
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br />
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br />
And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />
Signifying nothing.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<p>Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gracious my lord,<br />
I should report that which I say I saw,<br />
But know not how to do it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, say, sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I did stand my watch upon the hill,<br />
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,<br />
The wood began to move.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liar and slave!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:<br />
Within this three mile may you see it coming;<br />
I say, a moving grove.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thou speak'st false,<br />
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,<br />
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,<br />
I care not if thou dost for me as much.<br />
I pull in resolution, and begin<br />
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend<br />
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood<br />
Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood<br />
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!<br />
If this which he avouches does appear,<br />
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.<br />
I gin to be aweary of the sun,<br />
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.<br />
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!<br />
At least we'll die with harness on our back.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
