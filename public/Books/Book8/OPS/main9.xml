<p><em>Knocking within. Enter a Porter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a knocking indeed! If a<br />
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have<br />
old turning the key.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Knock,<br />
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of<br />
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged<br />
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in<br />
time; have napkins enow about you; here<br />
you'll sweat for't.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Knock,<br />
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's<br />
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could<br />
swear in both the scales against either scale;<br />
who committed treason enough for God's sake,<br />
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come<br />
in, equivocator.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Knock,<br />
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an<br />
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of<br />
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may<br />
roast your goose.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Knock,<br />
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But<br />
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter<br />
it no further: I had thought to have let in<br />
some of all professions that go the primrose<br />
way to the everlasting bonfire.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.<br /></p>
<p><em>Opens the gate</em></p>
<p><em>Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,<br />
That you do lie so late?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Faith sir, we were carousing till the<br />
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great<br />
provoker of three things.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What three things does drink especially provoke?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and<br />
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;<br />
it provokes the desire, but it takes<br />
away the performance: therefore, much drink<br />
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:<br />
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets<br />
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,<br />
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and<br />
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him<br />
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That it did, sir, i' the very throat on<br />
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I<br />
think, being too strong for him, though he took<br />
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast<br />
him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is thy master stirring?<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<p>Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, noble sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, both.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the king stirring, worthy thane?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not yet.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He did command me to call timely on him:<br />
I have almost slipp'd the hour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll bring you to him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know this is a joyful trouble to you;<br />
But yet 'tis one.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The labour we delight in physics pain.<br />
This is the door.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll make so bold to call,<br />
For 'tis my limited service.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goes the king hence to-day?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He does: he did appoint so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The night has been unruly: where we lay,<br />
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,<br />
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,<br />
And prophesying with accents terrible<br />
Of dire combustion and confused events<br />
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird<br />
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth<br />
Was feverous and did shake.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Twas a rough night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My young remembrance cannot parallel<br />
A fellow to it.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MACDUFF</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart<br />
Cannot conceive nor name thee!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong>&#160;<strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the matter.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!<br />
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope<br />
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence<br />
The life o' the building!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 't you say? the life?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mean you his majesty?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight<br />
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;<br />
See, and then speak yourselves.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX</em></p>
<p>Awake, awake!<br />
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!<br />
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!<br />
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,<br />
And look on death itself! up, up, and see<br />
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!<br />
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,<br />
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.<br /></p>
<p><em>Bell rings</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the business,<br />
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley<br />
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O gentle lady,<br />
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:<br />
The repetition, in a woman's ear,<br />
Would murder as it fell.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter BANQUO</em></p>
<p>O Banquo, Banquo,<br />
Our royal master 's murder'd!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woe, alas!<br />
What, in our house?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too cruel any where.<br />
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,<br />
And say it is not so.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had I but died an hour before this chance,<br />
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,<br />
There 's nothing serious in mortality:<br />
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;<br />
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees<br />
Is left this vault to brag of.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is amiss?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are, and do not know't:<br />
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood<br />
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your royal father 's murder'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, by whom?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:<br />
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;<br />
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found<br />
Upon their pillows:<br />
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life<br />
Was to be trusted with them.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, yet I do repent me of my fury,<br />
That I did kill them.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore did you so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,<br />
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:<br />
The expedition my violent love<br />
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,<br />
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;<br />
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature<br />
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,<br />
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers<br />
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,<br />
That had a heart to love, and in that heart<br />
Courage to make 's love kno wn?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help me hence, ho!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look to the lady.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,<br />
That most may claim this argument for ours?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,<br />
where our fate,<br />
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?<br />
Let 's away;<br />
Our tears are not yet brew'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow<br />
Upon the foot of motion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look to the lady:<br /></p>
<p><em>LADY MACBETH is carried out</em></p>
<p>And when we have our naked frailties hid,<br />
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,<br />
And question this most bloody piece of work,<br />
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:<br />
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence<br />
Against the undivulged pretence I fight<br />
Of treasonous malice.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACDUFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so do I.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So all.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's briefly put on manly readiness,<br />
And meet i' the hall together.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well contented.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What will you do? Let's not consort with them:<br />
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office<br />
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Ireland, I; our separated fortune<br />
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,<br />
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,<br />
The nearer bloody.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This murderous shaft that's shot<br />
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way<br />
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;<br />
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,<br />
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft<br />
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
