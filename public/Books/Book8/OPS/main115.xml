Luigi Vampa's Bill of Fare.</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He
awoke. To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with
velvet drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white
smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room,
the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on
awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream.
But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the
strongest doubt into certainty. "Yes, yes," he murmured, "I am in
the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf spoke." His
first idea was to breathe, that he might know whether he was
wounded. He borrowed this from "Don Quixote," the only book he had
ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.</p>
<p>"No," he cried, "they have not wounded, but perhaps they have
robbed me!" and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were
untouched; the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from
Rome to Venice were in his trousers pocket, and in that of his
great-coat he found the little note-case containing his letter of
credit for 5,050,000 francs. "Singular bandits!" he exclaimed;
"they have left me my purse and pocket-book. As I was saying last
night, they intend me to be ransomed. Hallo, here is my watch! Let
me see what time it is." Danglars' watch, one of Breguet's
repeaters, which he had carefully wound up on the previous night,
struck half past five. Without this, Danglars would have been quite
ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell. Should
he demand an explanation from the bandits, or should he wait
patiently for them to propose it? The last alternative seemed the
most prudent, so he waited until twelve o'clock. During all this
time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight o'clock, had been
watching his door. Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to
see the person who kept watch over him. He had noticed that a few
rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the
ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand
was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to
the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was
extremely unpleasant to Danglars. "Faugh!" he exclaimed, retreating
to the farther corner of his cell.</p>
<p>At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and
Danglars, wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached
the door again. He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large
eyes, thick lips, and a flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled
masses like snakes around his shoulders. "Ah, ha," cried Danglars,
"this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else; however, I am
rather too old and tough to be very good eating!" We see that
Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as though
to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black
bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring
voraciously. "May I be hanged," said Danglars, glancing at the
bandit's dinner through the crevices of the door, — "may I be
hanged if I can understand how people can eat such filth!" and he
withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of
the smell of the brandy.</p>
<p>But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are
certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which
appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his
own not to be very well supplied just then, and gradually the man
appeared less ugly, the bread less black, and the cheese more
fresh, while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind
certain sauces and side-dishes, which his cook prepared in a very
superior manner whenever he said, "Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a
nice little fricassee to-day." He got up and knocked on the door;
the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew that he was heard, so he
redoubled his blows. "Che cosa?" asked the bandit. "Come, come,"
said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, "I think it is
quite time to think of giving me something to eat!" But whether he
did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders
respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without
answering, went on with his dinner. Danglars' feelings were hurt,
and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the
banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not
breathe another word.</p>
<p>Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another
bandit. Danglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at
the stomach, arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of
the door, and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide.
It was, indeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as
comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door,
and placing between his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-pease
stewed with bacon. Near the pan he also placed a pretty little
basket of Villetri grapes and a flask of Orvieto. Peppino was
decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched these preparations and his
mouth watered. "Come," he said to himself, "let me try if he will
be more tractable than the other;" and he tapped gently at the
door. "On y va," (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting
the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its
idioms.</p>
<p>Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called
out in such a furious manner, "Put in your head!" But this was not
the time for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner
and said with a gracious smile, — "Excuse me, sir, but are they not
going to give me any dinner?"</p>
<p>"Does your excellency happen to be hungry?"</p>
<p>"Happen to be hungry, — that's pretty good, when I haven't eaten
for twenty-four hours!" muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud,
"Yes, sir, I am hungry — very hungry."</p>
<p>"What would your excellency like?" and Peppino placed his pan on
the ground, so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of
Danglars. "Give your orders."</p>
<p>"Have you kitchens here?"</p>
<p>"Kitchens? — of course — complete ones."</p>
<p>"And cooks?"</p>
<p>"Excellent!"</p>
<p>"Well, a fowl, fish, game, — it signifies little, so that I
eat."</p>
<p>"As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a fowl." Peppino, turning around, shouted, "A fowl for his
excellency!" His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome,
graceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a
silver dish on his head, without the assistance of his hands. "I
could almost believe myself at the Cafe de Paris," murmured
Danglars.</p>
<p>"Here, your excellency," said Peppino, taking the fowl from the
young bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the
stool and the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the
cell. Danglars asked for a knife and fork. "Here, excellency," said
Peppino, offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork.
Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other, and
was about to cut up the fowl. "Pardon me, excellency," said
Peppino, placing his hand on the banker's shoulder; "people pay
here before they eat. They might not be satisfied, and" —</p>
<p>"Ah, ha," thought Danglars, "this is not so much like Paris,
except that I shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I'll fix that
all right. I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I
should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome. — There,"
he said, throwing a louis down. Peppino picked up the louis, and
Danglars again prepared to carve the fowl. "Stay a moment, your
excellency," said Peppino, rising; "you still owe me
something."</p>
<p>"I said they would skin me," thought Danglars; but resolving to
resist the extortion, he said, "Come, how much do I owe you for
this fowl?"</p>
<p>"Your excellency has given me a louis on account."</p>
<p>"A louis on account for a fowl?"</p>
<p>"Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis."
Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.
"Come, come, this is very droll — very amusing — I allow; but, as I
am very hungry, pray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis
for you."</p>
<p>"Then that will make only 4,998 louis more," said Peppino with
the same indifference. "I shall get them all in time."</p>
<p>"Oh, as for that," said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of
the jest, — "as for that you won't get them at all. Go to the
devil! You do not know with whom you have to deal!" Peppino made a
sign, and the youth hastily removed the fowl. Danglars threw
himself upon his goat-skin, and Peppino, reclosing the door, again
began eating his pease and bacon. Though Danglars could not see
Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his
occupation. He was certainly eating, and noisily too, like an
ill-bred man. "Brute!" said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to hear
him, and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly.
Danglars' stomach felt so empty, that it seemed as if it would be
impossible ever to fill it again; still he had patience for another
half-hour, which appeared to him like a century. He again arose and
went to the door. "Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any
longer, but tell me what they want."</p>
<p>"Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you
want. Give your orders, and we will execute them."</p>
<p>"Then open the door directly." Peppino obeyed. "Now look here, I
want something to eat! To eat — do you hear?"</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>"Come, you understand me."</p>
<p>"What would your excellency like to eat?"</p>
<p>"A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in
this accursed place."</p>
<p>"Bread? Very well. Hallo, there, some bread!" he called. The
youth brought a small loaf. "How much?" asked Danglars.</p>
<p>"Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis," said
Peppino; "You have paid two louis in advance."</p>
<p>"What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?"</p>
<p>"One hundred thousand francs," repeated Peppino.</p>
<p>"But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!"</p>
<p>"We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies
nothing whether you eat much or little — whether you have ten
dishes or one — it is always the same price."</p>
<p>"What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is
perfectly ridiculous — stupid! You had better tell me at once that
you intend starving me to death."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit
suicide. Pay and eat."</p>
<p>"And what am I to pay with, brute?" said Danglars, enraged. "Do
you suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?"</p>
<p>"Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will
be fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the
50,000."</p>
<p>Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he
understood the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he
had done just before. "Come," he said, "if I pay you the 100,000
francs, will you be satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Peppino.</p>
<p>"But how can I pay them?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs.
Thomson &amp; French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for
4,998 louis on these gentlemen, and our banker shall take it."
Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took
the pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and
signed it. "Here," he said, "here is a draft at sight."</p>
<p>"And here is your fowl." Danglars sighed while he carved the
fowl; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost. As for
Peppino, he examined the paper attentively, put it into his pocket,
and continued eating his pease.</p>
