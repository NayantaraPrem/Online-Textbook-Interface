<h3 class="section_title">10. Distinct Species Present Analogous
Variations, So That A Variety Of One Species Often Assumes A
Character Proper To An Allied Species, Or Reverts To Some Of The
Characters Of An Early Progenitor</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to
our domestic races. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in
countries widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed
feathers on the head, and with feathers on the feet, characters not
possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous
variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent presence of
fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be
considered as a variation representing the normal structure of
another race, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt that
all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the
pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution
and tendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown
influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous
variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots, of
the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several botanists
rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if
this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in
two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added,
namely, the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of each
species having been independently created, we should have to
attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three
plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a
consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate
yet closely related acts of creation. Many similar cases of
analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the great gourd
family, and by various authors in our cereals. Similar cases
occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been
discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them
under his law of equable variability.</p>
<p>With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the
occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with
two black bars on the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the
tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases
with white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent
rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case
of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in
the several breeds. We may, I think, confidently come to this
conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are
eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct
and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing
in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the
slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the
mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.</p>
<p>No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should
reappear after having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of
generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some
other breed, the offspring occasionally show for many generations a
tendency to revert in character to the foreign breedâ€”some say, for
a dozen or even a score of generations. After twelve generations,
the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, from one
ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally
believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this remnant
of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed, but in
which BOTH parents have lost some character which their progenitor
possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the
lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can
see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any number of
generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed,
reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable
hypothesis is, not that one individual suddenly takes after an
ancestor removed by some hundred generations, but that in each
successive generation the character in question has been lying
latent, and at last, under unknown favourable conditions, is
developed. With the barb-pigeon, for instance, which very rarely
produces a blue bird, it is probable that there is a latent
tendency in each generation to produce blue plumage. The abstract
improbability of such a tendency being transmitted through a vast
number of generations, is not greater than that of quite useless or
rudimentary organs being similarly transmitted. A mere tendency to
produce a rudiment is indeed sometimes thus inherited.</p>
<p>As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be
descended from a common progenitor, it might be expected that they
would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that the
varieties of two or more species would resemble each other, or that
a variety of one species would resemble in certain characters
another and distinct species, this other species being, according
to our view, only a well-marked and permanent variety. But
characters exclusively due to analogous variation would probably be
of an unimportant nature, for the preservation of all functionally
important characters will have been determined through natural
selection, in accordance with the different habits of the species.
It might further be expected that the species of the same genus
would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost characters. As,
however, we do not know the common ancestor of any natural group,
we cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous
characters. If, for instance, we did not know that the parent
rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not
have told, whether such characters in our domestic breeds were
reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred
that the blue colour was a case of reversion from the number of the
markings, which are correlated with this tint, and which would not
probably have all appeared together from simple variation. More
especially we might have inferred this from the blue colour and the
several marks so often appearing when differently coloured breeds
are crossed. Hence, although under nature it must generally be left
doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly existing
characters, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we
ought, on our theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a
species assuming characters which are already present in other
members of the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case.</p>
<p>The difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due
to the varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same
genus. A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms
intermediate between two other forms, which themselves can only
doubtfully be ranked as species; and this shows, unless all these
closely allied forms be considered as independently created
species, that they have in varying assumed some of the characters
of the others. But the best evidence of analogous variations is
afforded by parts or organs which are generally constant in
character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble, in some
degree, the same part or organ in an allied species. I have
collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie
under the great disadvantage of not being able to give them. I can
only repeat that such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very
remarkable.</p>
<p>I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed
as affecting any important character, but from occurring in several
species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly
under nature. It is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass
sometimes has very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those
on the legs of a zebra. It has been asserted that these are
plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which I have made, I
believe this to be true. The stripe on the shoulder is sometimes
double, and is very variable in length and outline. A white ass,
but NOT an albino, has been described without either spinal or
shoulder stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or
actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan of Pallas
is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. Mr. Blyth
has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct
shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been
informed by Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally
striped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though
so plainly barred like a zebra over the body, is without bars on
the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen with very distinct
zebra-like bars on the hocks.</p>
<p>With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of
the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL
colours; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns,
mouse-duns, and in one instance in a chestnut; a faint
shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a
trace in a bay horse. My son made a careful examination and sketch
for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each
shoulder and with leg-stripes. I have myself seen a dun Devonshire
pony, and a small dun Welsh pony has been carefully described to
me, both with THREE parallel stripes on each shoulder.</p>
<p>In the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is
so generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who
examined this breed for the Indian Government, a horse without
stripes is not considered as purely bred. The spine is always
striped; the legs are generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe,
which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is common; the side
of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. The stripes are often
plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses.
Colonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped
when first foaled. I have also reason to suspect, from information
given me by Mr. W.W. Edwards, that with the English race-horse the
spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full-grown
animal. I have myself recently bred a foal from a bay mare
(offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by a bay English
race-horse. This foal, when a week old, was marked on its hinder
quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark,
zebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped. All the stripes
soon disappeared completely. Without here entering on further
details I may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder
stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries
from Britain to Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the
Malay Archipelago in the south. In all parts of the world these
stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun
a large range of colour is included, from one between brown and
black to a close approach to cream colour.</p>
<p>I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this
subject, believes that the several breeds of the horse are
descended from several aboriginal species, one of which, the dun,
was striped; and that the above-described appearances are all due
to ancient crosses with the dun stock. But this view may be safely
rejected, for it is highly improbable that the heavy Belgian
cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the lanky Kattywar race,
etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the world, should have
all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal stock.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species
of the horse genus. Rollin asserts that the common mule from the
ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs;
according to Mr. Gosse, in certain parts of the United States,
about nine out of ten mules have striped legs. I once saw a mule
with its legs so much striped that any one might have thought that
it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.C. Martin, in his excellent
treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule. In
four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the
ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest
of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe.
In Lord Morton's famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male
quagga, the hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently
produced from the same mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more
plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.
Lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a hybrid has been
figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs me that he knows of a second
case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the
ass only occasionally has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has
none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four
legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those on
the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and even had some zebra-like
stripes on the sides of its face. With respect to this last fact, I
was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what
is commonly called chance, that I was led solely from the
occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and
hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever
occurred in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and
was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several
distinct species of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation,
striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like
an ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun
tint appearsâ€”a tint which approaches to that of the general
colouring of the other species of the genus. The appearance of the
stripes is not accompanied by any change of form, or by any other
new character. We see this tendency to become striped most strongly
displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct
species. Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons:
they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three
sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain
bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple
variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably
reappear; but without any other change of form or character. When
the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see
a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear
in the mongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to
account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, isâ€”that
there is a TENDENCY in the young of each successive generation to
produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency, from
unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in
several species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer
or appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the
breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries,
species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the
species of the horse genus! For myself, I venture confidently to
look back thousands on thousands of generations, and I see an
animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently
constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse (whether or
not it be descended from one or more wild stocks) of the ass, the
hemionus, quagga, and zebra.</p>
<p>He who believes that each equine species was independently
created, will, I presume, assert that each species has been created
with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication,
in this particular manner, so as often to become striped like the
other species of the genus; and that each has been created with a
strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant
quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their
stripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. To
admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an
unreal, or at least for an unknown cause. It makes the works of God
a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with
the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never
lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now
living on the sea-shore.</p>
