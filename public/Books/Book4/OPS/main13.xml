<h3 class="section_title">2. Individual Differences</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The many slight differences which appear in the offspring from
the same parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen,
from being observed in the individuals of the same species
inhabiting the same confined locality, may be called individual
differences. No one supposes that all the individuals of the same
species are cast in the same actual mould. These individual
differences are of the highest importance for us, for they are
often inherited, as must be familiar to every one; and they thus
afford materials for natural selection to act on and accumulate, in
the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction
individual differences in his domesticated productions. These
individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider
unimportant parts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts,
that parts which must be called important, whether viewed under a
physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in
the individuals of the same species. I am convinced that the most
experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the
cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which
he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a
course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far
from being pleased at finding variability in important characters,
and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine
internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens
of the same species. It would never have been expected that the
branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of
an insect would have been variable in the same species; it might
have been thought that changes of this nature could have been
effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J. Lubbock has shown a
degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may
almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a
tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also shown that
the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are far from uniform.
Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important
organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank those
parts as important (as some few naturalists have honestly
confessed) which do not vary; and, under this point of view, no
instance will ever be found of an important part varying; but under
any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.</p>
<p>There is one point connected with individual differences which
is extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been
called "protean" or "polymorphic," in which species present an
inordinate amount of variation. With respect to many of these
forms, hardly two naturalists agree whether to rank them as species
or as varieties. We may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among
plants, several genera of insects, and of Brachiopod shells. In
most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite
characters. Genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be,
with a few exceptions, polymorphic in other countries, and
likewise, judging from Brachiopod shells, at former periods of
time. These facts are very perplexing, for they seem to show that
this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life.
I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in some of these
polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or
disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been
seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter
to be explained.</p>
<p>Individuals of the same species often present, as is known to
every one, great differences of structure, independently of
variation, as in the two sexes of various animals, in the two or
three castes of sterile females or workers among insects, and in
the immature and larval states of many of the lower animals. There
are, also, cases of dimorphism and trimorphism, both with animals
and plants. Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has lately called attention to
the subject, has shown that the females of certain species of
butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly appear under two
or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not connected by
intermediate varieties. Fritz Muller has described analogous but
more extraordinary cases with the males of certain Brazilian
Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs under two
distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently shaped
pincers, and the other has antennae much more abundantly furnished
with smelling-hairs. Although in most of these cases, the two or
three forms, both with animals and plants, are not now connected by
intermediate gradations, it is possible that they were once thus
connected. Mr. Wallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly
which presents in the same island a great range of varieties
connected by intermediate links, and the extreme links of the chain
closely resemble the two forms of an allied dimorphic species
inhabiting another part of the Malay Archipelago. Thus also with
ants, the several worker-castes are generally quite distinct; but
in some cases, as we shall hereafter see, the castes are connected
together by finely graduated varieties. So it is, as I have myself
observed, with some dimorphic plants. It certainly at first appears
a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly should have
the power of producing at the same time three distinct female forms
and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce from the
same seed- capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing
three different kinds of females and three or even six different
kinds of males. Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of
the common fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes
which sometimes differ from each other in a wonderful manner.</p>
