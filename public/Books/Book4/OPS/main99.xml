<h3 class="section_title">5. Alternate Glacial Periods In The North
And South</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>But we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced
that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with
the plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western
shores of Britain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees.
We may infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain
vegetation, that Siberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon,
according to Dr. Hooker, perpetual snow formerly covered the
central axis, and fed glaciers which rolled 4,000 feet down the
valleys. The same observer has recently found great moraines at a
low level on the Atlas range in North Africa. Along the Himalaya,
at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their
former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on
ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of the Asiatic continent,
on the opposite side of the equator, we know, from the excellent
researches of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in New Zealand
immense glaciers formerly descended to a low level; and the same
plants, found by Dr. Hooker on widely separated mountains in this
island tell the same story of a former cold period. From facts
communicated to me by the Rev. W.B. Clarke, it appears also that
there are traces of former glacial action on the mountains of the
south- eastern corner of Australia.</p>
<p>Looking to America: in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of
rock have been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as
far south as latitude 36 and 37 degrees, and on the shores of the
Pacific, where the climate is now so different, as far south as
latitude 46 degrees. Erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on
the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera of South America, nearly
under the equator, glaciers once extended far below their present
level. In central Chile I examined a vast mound of detritus with
great boulders, crossing the Portillo valley, which, there can
hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine; and Mr. D. Forbes
informs me that he found in various parts of the Cordillera, from
latitude 13 to 30 degrees south, at about the height of 12,000
feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was
familiar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus,
including grooved pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera
true glaciers do not now exist even at much more considerable
heights. Further south, on both sides of the continent, from
latitude 41 degrees to the southernmost extremity, we have the
clearest evidence of former glacial action, in numerous immense
boulders transported far from their parent source.</p>
<p>From these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having
extended all round the northern and southern hemispheres—from the
period having been in a geological sense recent in both
hemispheres—from its having lasted in both during a great length of
time, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected—and
lastly, from glaciers having recently descended to a low level
along the whole line of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to
me that we could not avoid the conclusion that the temperature of
the whole world had been simultaneously lowered during the Glacial
period. But now, Mr. Croll, in a series of admirable memoirs, has
attempted to show that a glacial condition of climate is the result
of various physical causes, brought into operation by an increase
in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. All these causes tend
towards the same end; but the most powerful appears to be the
indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit upon oceanic
currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly recur
every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals
are extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the
most important, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relative position
of the land and water. Mr. Croll believes that the last great
glacial period occurred about 240,000 years ago, and endured, with
slight alterations of climate, for about 160,000 years. With
respect to more ancient glacial periods, several geologists are
convinced, from direct evidence, that such occurred during the
miocene and eocene formations, not to mention still more ancient
formations. But the most important result for us, arrived at by Mr.
Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere passes through a
cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere is actually
raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly through
changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So conversely it
will be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern passes
through a glacial period. This conclusion throws so much light on
geographical distribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in
it; but I will first give the facts which demand an
explanation.</p>
<p>In South America, Dr. Hooker has shown that besides many closely
allied species, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of
Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty
flora, are common to North America and Europe, enormously remote as
these areas in opposite hemispheres are from each other. On the
lofty mountains of equatorial America a host of peculiar species
belonging to European genera occur. On the Organ Mountains of
Brazil some few temperate European, some Antarctic and some Andean
genera were found by Gardner which do not exist in the low
intervening hot countries. On the Silla of Caraccas the illustrious
Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic
of the Cordillera.</p>
<p>In Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe, and some few
representatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur on the
mountains of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few
European species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and
on the mountains several representative European forms are found
which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of
Africa. Dr. Hooker has also lately shown that several of the plants
living on the upper parts of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and
on the neighbouring Cameroon Mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are
closely related to those on the mountains of Abyssinia, and
likewise to those of temperate Europe. It now also appears, as I
hear from Dr. Hooker, that some of these same temperate plants have
been discovered by the Rev. R.T. Lowe on the mountains of the Cape
Verde Islands. This extension of the same temperate forms, almost
under the equator, across the whole continent of Africa and to the
mountains of the Cape Verde archipelago, is one of the most
astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.</p>
<p>On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain ranges of the
peninsula of India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic
cones of Java, many plants occur either identically the same or
representing each other, and at the same time representing plants
of Europe not found in the intervening hot lowlands. A list of the
genera of plants collected on the loftier peaks of Java, raises a
picture of a collection made on a hillock in Europe. Still more
striking is the fact that peculiar Australian forms are represented
by certain plants growing on the summits of the mountains of
Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker,
extend along the heights of the peninsula of Malacca, and are
thinly scattered on the one hand over India, and on the other hand
as far north as Japan.</p>
<p>On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Muller has
discovered several European species; other species, not introduced
by man, occur on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I
am informed by Dr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia,
but not in the intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable
"Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand," by Dr. Hooker,
analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of
that large island. Hence, we see that certain plants growing on the
more lofty mountains of the tropics in all parts of the world, and
on the temperate plains of the north and south, are either the same
species or varieties of the same species. It should, however, be
observed that these plants are not strictly arctic forms; for, as
Mr. H.C. Watson has remarked, "in receding from polar toward
equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain flora really become
less and less Arctic." Besides these identical and closely allied
forms, many species inhabiting the same widely sundered areas,
belong to genera not now found in the intermediate tropical
lowlands.</p>
<p>These brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few
analogous facts could be given in regard to terrestrial animals. In
marine productions, similar cases likewise occur; as an example, I
may quote a statement by the highest authority, Prof. Dana, that
"it is certainly a wonderful fact that New Zealand should have a
closer resemblance in its crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode,
than to any other part of the world." Sir J. Richardson, also,
speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New Zealand, Tasmania,
etc., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs me that
twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to
Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical
seas.</p>
<p>From the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate
forms on the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and
along the Peninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago,
and in a less well-marked manner across the wide expanse of
tropical South America, it appears almost certain that at some
former period, no doubt during the most severe part of a Glacial
period, the lowlands of these great continents were everywhere
tenanted under the equator by a considerable number of temperate
forms. At this period the equatorial climate at the level of the
sea was probably about the same with that now experienced at the
height of from five to six thousand feet under the same latitude,
or perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest period, the
lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled
tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as
growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand
feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still
greater preponderance of temperate forms. So again in the
mountainous island of Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann
found temperate European forms beginning to appear at the height of
about five thousand feet. On the mountains of Panama, at the height
of only two thousand feet, Dr. Seemann found the vegetation like
that of Mexico, "with forms of the torrid zone harmoniously blended
with those of the temperate."</p>
<p>Now let us see whether Mr. Croll's conclusion that when the
northern hemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great
Glacial period, the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws
any clear light on the present apparently inexplicable distribution
of various organisms in the temperate parts of both hemispheres,
and on the mountains of the tropics. The Glacial period, as
measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember
over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have
spread within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for
any amount of migration. As the cold became more and more intense,
we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and from
the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the
more vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate forms
invaded the equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot
lowlands would at the same time have migrated to the tropical and
subtropical regions of the south, for the southern hemisphere was
at this period warmer. On the decline of the Glacial period, as
both hemispheres gradually recovered their former temperature, the
northern temperate forms living on the lowlands under the equator,
would have been driven to their former homes or have been
destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning from
the south. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would
almost certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if
sufficiently lofty, they would have long survived like the Arctic
forms on the mountains of Europe. They might have survived, even if
the climate was not perfectly fitted for them, for the change of
temperature must have been very slow, and plants undoubtedly
possess a certain capacity for acclimatisation, as shown by their
transmitting to their offspring different constitutional powers of
resisting heat and cold.</p>
<p>In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in
its turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern
hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms
would invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had
before been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with
the southern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would
return to their former homes, leaving some few species on the
mountains, and carrying southward with them some of the northern
temperate forms which had descended from their mountain fastnesses.
Thus, we should have some few species identically the same in the
northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the
intermediate tropical regions. But the species left during a long
time on these mountains, or in opposite hemispheres, would have to
compete with many new forms and would be exposed to somewhat
different physical conditions; hence, they would be eminently
liable to modification, and would generally now exist as varieties
or as representative species; and this is the case. We must, also,
bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial
periods; for these will account, in accordance with the same
principles, for the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same
widely separated areas, and belonging to genera not now found in
the intermediate torrid zones.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in
regard to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia,
that many more identical or slightly modified species have migrated
from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see,
however, a few southern forms on the mountains of Borneo and
Abyssinia. I suspect that this preponderant migration from the
north to the south is due to the greater extent of land in the
north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes
in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through
natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection,
or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when the
two sets became commingled in the equatorial regions, during the
alternations of the Glacial periods, the northern forms were the
more powerful and were able to hold their places on the mountains,
and afterwards migrate southward with the southern forms; but not
so the southern in regard to the northern forms. In the same
manner, at the present day, we see that very many European
productions cover the ground in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a
lesser degree in Australia, and have beaten the natives; whereas
extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of
the northern hemisphere, though hides, wool, and other objects
likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into Europe during
the last two or three centuries from La Plata and during the last
forty or fifty years from Australia. The Neilgherrie Mountains in
India, however, offer a partial exception; for here, as I hear from
Dr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly sowing themselves and
becoming naturalised. Before the last great Glacial period, no
doubt the intertropical mountains were stocked with endemic Alpine
forms; but these have almost everywhere yielded to the more
dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient
workshops of the north. In many islands the native productions are
nearly equalled, or even outnumbered, by those which have become
naturalised; and this is the first stage towards their extinction.
Mountains are islands on the land; and their inhabitants have
yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north,
just in the same way as the inhabitants of real islands have
everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental forms
naturalised through man's agency.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial
animals and of marine productions, in the northern and southern
temperate zones, and on the intertropical mountains. When, during
the height of the Glacial period, the ocean-currents were widely
different to what they now are, some of the inhabitants of the
temperate seas might have reached the equator; of these a few would
perhaps at once be able to migrate southwards, by keeping to the
cooler currents, while others might remain and survive in the
colder depths until the southern hemisphere was in its turn
subjected to a glacial climate and permitted their further
progress; in nearly the same manner as, according to Forbes,
isolated spaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the
present day in the deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.</p>
<p>I am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to
the distribution and affinities of the identical and allied
species, which now live so widely separated in the north and south,
and sometimes on the intermediate mountain ranges, are removed on
the views above given. The exact lines of migration cannot be
indicated. We cannot say why certain species and not others have
migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given
rise to new forms, while others have remained unaltered. We cannot
hope to explain such facts, until we can say why one species and
not another becomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land;
why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or
thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.</p>
<p>Various special difficulties also remain to be solved; for
instance, the occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same
plants at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New
Zealand, and Fuegia; but icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have
been concerned in their dispersal. The existence at these and other
distant points of the southern hemisphere, of species, which,
though distinct, belong to genera exclusively confined to the
south, is a more remarkable case. Some of these species are so
distinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the
commencement of the last Glacial period for their migration and
subsequent modification to the necessary degree. The facts seem to
indicate that distinct species belonging to the same genera have
migrated in radiating lines from a common centre; and I am inclined
to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a former
and warmer period, before the commencement of the last Glacial
period, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a
highly peculiar and isolated flora. It may be suspected that before
this flora was exterminated during the last Glacial epoch, a few
forms had been already widely dispersed to various points of the
southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the
aid, as halting-places, of now sunken islands. Thus the southern
shores of America, Australia, and New Zealand may have become
slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of life.</p>
<p>Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language
almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of
climate throughout the world on geographical distribution. And we
have now seen that Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial
periods in the one hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the
opposite hemisphere, together with the admission of the slow
modification of species, explains a multitude of facts in the
distribution of the same and of the allied forms of life in all
parts of the globe. The living waters have flowed during one period
from the north and during another from the south, and in both cases
have reached the equator; but the stream of life has flowed with
greater force from the north than in the opposite direction, and
has consequently more freely inundated the south. As the tide
leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores
where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their
living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from
the Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator. The
various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races
of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of
almost every land, which serves as a record, full of interest to
us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.</p>
