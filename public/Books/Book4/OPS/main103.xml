<h3 class="section_title">3. Absence Of Batrachians And Terrestrial
Mammals On Oceanic Islands</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>With respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on
oceanic islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that
Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) are never found on any of the
many islands with which the great oceans are studded. I have taken
pains to verify this assertion, and have found it true, with the
exception of New Zealand, New Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and
perhaps the Solomon Islands and the Seychelles. But I have already
remarked that it is doubtful whether New Zealand and New Caledonia
ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and this is still more
doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon groups and the
Seychelles. This general absence of frogs, toads and newts on so
many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical
conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted for
these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the
Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a
nuisance. But as these animals and their spawn are immediately
killed (with the exception, as far as known, of one Indian species)
by sea-water, there would be great difficulty in their transportal
across the sea, and therefore we can see why they do not exist on
strictly oceanic islands. But why, on the theory of creation, they
should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to
explain.</p>
<p>Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully
searched the oldest voyages, and have not found a single instance,
free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated
animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated above
300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many
islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. The
Falkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come
nearest to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as
oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the mainland at a
distance of about 280 miles; moreover, icebergs formerly brought
boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly
transported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions.
Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support at least
small mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very
small islands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an
island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become
naturalised and greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the
ordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the
creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently
ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have
suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time
for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes;
and on continents it is known that new species of mammals appear
and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals.
Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands,
aerial mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand
possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island,
the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne
Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why,
it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and
no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can
easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported
across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been
seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North
American species, either regularly or occasionally, visit Bermuda,
at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr.
Tomes, who has specially studied this family, that many species
have enormous ranges, and are found on continents and on far
distant islands. Hence, we have only to suppose that such wandering
species have been modified in their new homes in relation to their
new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on
oceanic islands, with the absence of all other terrestrial
mammals.</p>
<p>Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth
of the sea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest
continent, and the degree of affinity of their mammalian
inhabitants. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations
on this head, since greatly extended by Mr. Wallace's admirable
researches, in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is
traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean, and this separates
two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On either side, the islands
stand on a moderately shallow submarine bank, and these islands are
inhabited by the same or by closely allied quadrupeds. I have not
as yet had time to follow up this subject in all quarters of the
world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds good. For
instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from Europe,
and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with all
the islands near the shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands,
on the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one
thousand fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the
species and even the genera are quite distinct. As the amount of
modification which animals of all kinds undergo partly depends on
the lapse of time, and as the islands which are separated from each
other, or from the mainland, by shallow channels, are more likely
to have been continuously united within a recent period than the
islands separated by deeper channels, we can understand how it is
that a relation exists between the depth of the sea separating two
mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity, a relation
which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of
creation.</p>
<p>The foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic
islands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large
proportion consisting of endemic forms—the members of certain
groups, but not those of other groups in the same class, having
been modified—the absence of certain whole orders, as of
batrachians and of terrestrial mammals, notwithstanding the
presence of aerial bats, the singular proportions of certain orders
of plants, herbaceous forms having been developed into trees, etc.,
seem to me to accord better with the belief in the efficiency of
occasional means of transport, carried on during a long course of
time, than with the belief in the former connection of all oceanic
islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter view it is
probable that the various classes would have immigrated more
uniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their
mutual relations would not have been much disturbed, and
consequently, they would either have not been modified, or all the
species in a more equable manner.</p>
<p>I do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in
understanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote
islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or
subsequently modified, have reached their present homes. But the
probability of other islands having once existed as halting-places,
of which not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will
specify one difficult case. Almost all oceanic islands, even the
most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally
by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere
striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A.A. Gould in
relation to the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are
easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have
tried, sink in it and are killed. Yet there must be some unknown,
but occasionally efficient means for their transportal. Would the
just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting
on the ground and thus get transported? It occurred to me that
land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm
over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted
timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I find that
several species in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in
sea-water during seven days. One shell, the Helix pomatia, after
having been thus treated, and again hybernating, was put into
sea-water for twenty days and perfectly recovered. During this
length of time the shell might have been carried by a marine
country of average swiftness to a distance of 660 geographical
miles. As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum I removed it,
and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again immersed it
for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and crawled
away. Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments. He
placed 100 land- shells, belonging to ten species, in a box pierced
with holes, and immersed it for a fortnight in the sea. Out of the
hundred shells twenty-seven recovered. The presence of an operculum
seems to have been of importance, as out of twelve specimens of
Cyclostoma elegans, which is thus furnished, eleven revived. It is
remarkable, seeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted with me the
salt-water, that not one of fifty-four specimens belonging to four
other species of Helix tried by Aucapitaine recovered. It is,
however, not at all probable that land-shells have often been thus
transported; the feet of birds offer a more probable method.</p>
