<div class="text">
<p>I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of “Jane
Eyre” affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to
explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one
work alone.&#160; If, therefore, the authorship of other works of
fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is
not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.</p>
<p>This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may
already have been made, and to prevent future errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">CURRER BELL.</p>
