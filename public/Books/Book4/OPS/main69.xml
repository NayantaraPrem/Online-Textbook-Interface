<div class="text">
<p>I have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the
mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the
variations are inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to
show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will
dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each
animal. Therefore, there is no real difficulty, under changing
conditions of life, in natural selection accumulating to any extent
slight modifications of instinct which are in any way useful. In
many cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play. I
do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in
any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to
the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other hand, the fact
that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to
mistakes; that no instinct can be shown to have been produced for
the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the
instincts of others; that the canon in natural history, of "Natura
non facit saltum," is applicable to instincts as well as to
corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing
views, but is otherwise inexplicable—all tend to corroborate the
theory of natural selection.</p>
<p>This theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in
regard to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but
distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and
living under considerably different conditions of life, yet often
retaining nearly the same instincts. For instance, we can
understand, on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the
thrush of tropical South America lines its nest with mud, in the
same peculiar manner as does our British thrush; how it is that the
Hornbills of Africa and India have the same extraordinary instinct
of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a hole in a tree,
with only a small hole left in the plaster through which the males
feed them and their young when hatched; how it is that the male
wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build "cock-nests," to roost
in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,—a habit wholly unlike that
of any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical
deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to
look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its
foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the larvae of ichneumonidae
feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, not as specially
endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one
general law leading to the advancement of all organic
beings—namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the
weakest die.</p>
