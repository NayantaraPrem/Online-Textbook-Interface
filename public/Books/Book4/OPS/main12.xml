<p>Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to
organic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss
whether these latter are subject to any variation. To treat this
subject properly, a long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given;
but these I shall reserve for a future work. Nor shall I here
discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term
species. No one definition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every
naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.
Generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act
of creation. The term "variety" is almost equally difficult to
define; but here community of descent is almost universally
implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also what are
called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a
monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of
structure, generally injurious, or not useful to the species. Some
authors use the term "variation" in a technical sense, as implying
a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life; and
"variations" in this sense are supposed not to be inherited; but
who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish
waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the
thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some
cases be inherited for at least a few generations? And in this case
I presume that the form would be called a variety.</p>
<p>It may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of
structure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions,
more especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a
state of nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so
beautifully related to its complex conditions of life that it seems
as improbable that any part should have been suddenly produced
perfect, as that a complex machine should have been invented by man
in a perfect state. Under domestication monstrosities sometimes
occur which resemble normal structures in widely different animals.
Thus pigs have occasionally been born with a sort of proboscis, and
if any wild species of the same genus had naturally possessed a
proboscis, it might have been argued that this had appeared as a
monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to find, after diligent
search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in
nearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the question. If
monstrous forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature
and are capable of reproduction (which is not always the case), as
they occur rarely and singly, their preservation would depend on
unusually favourable circumstances. They would, also, during the
first and succeeding generations cross with the ordinary form, and
thus their abnormal character would almost inevitably be lost. But
I shall have to return in a future chapter to the preservation and
perpetuation of single or occasional variations.</p>
