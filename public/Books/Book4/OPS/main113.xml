<div class="text">
<p>In this chapter I have attempted to show that the arrangement of
all organic beings throughout all time in groups under groups—that
the nature of the relationships by which all living and extinct
organisms are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of
affinities into a few grand classes—the rules followed and the
difficulties encountered by naturalists in their
classifications—the value set upon characters, if constant and
prevalent, whether of high or of the most trifling importance, or,
as with rudimentary organs of no importance—the wide opposition in
value between analogical or adaptive characters, and characters of
true affinity; and other such rules—all naturally follow if we
admit the common parentage of allied forms, together with their
modification through variation and natural selection, with the
contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. In
considering this view of classification, it should be borne in mind
that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking
together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged
varieties of the same species, however much they may differ from
each other in structure. If we extend the use of this element of
descent—the one certainly known cause of similarity in organic
beings—we shall understand what is meant by the Natural System: it
is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of
acquired difference marked by the terms, varieties, species,
genera, families, orders, and classes.</p>
<p>On this same view of descent with modification, most of the
great facts in Morphology become intelligible—whether we look to
the same pattern displayed by the different species of the same
class in their homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, or
to the serial and lateral homologies in each individual animal and
plant.</p>
<p>On the principle of successive slight variations, not
necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of
life, and being inherited at a corresponding period, we can
understand the leading facts in embryology; namely, the close
resemblance in the individual embryo of the parts which are
homologous, and which when matured become widely different in
structure and function; and the resemblance of the homologous parts
or organs in allied though distinct species, though fitted in the
adult state for habits as different as is possible. Larvae are
active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater
or less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their
modifications inherited at a corresponding early age. On these same
principles, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in
size, either from disuse or through natural selection, it will
generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide
for its own wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the force of
inheritance—the occurrence of rudimentary organs might even have
been anticipated. The importance of embryological characters and of
rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view
that a natural arrangement must be genealogical.</p>
<p>Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered
in this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the
innumerable species, genera and families, with which this world is
peopled, are all descended, each within its own class or group,
from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of
descent, that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if
it were unsupported by other facts or arguments.</p>
