<h3 class="section_title">4. On The Relations Of The Inhabitants Of
Islands To Those Of The Nearest Mainland</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of
the species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland,
without being actually the same. Numerous instances could be given.
The Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a
distance of between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South
America. Here almost every product of the land and of the water
bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are
twenty-six land birds. Of these twenty-one, or perhaps
twenty-three, are ranked as distinct species, and would commonly be
assumed to have been here created; yet the close affinity of most
of these birds to American species is manifest in every character
in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with the
other animals, and with a large proportion of the plants, as shown
by Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The
naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in
the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent,
feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so?
Why should the species which are supposed to have been created in
the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the
stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in
the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in
their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several
classes are associated together, which closely resembles the
conditions of the South American coast. In fact, there is a
considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other
hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic
nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the
islands, between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but
what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The
inhabitants of the Cape Verde Islands are related to those of
Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. Facts, such as
these, admit of no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of
independent creation; whereas, on the view here maintained, it is
obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive
colonists from America, whether by occasional means of transport or
(though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly continuous
land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists would
be liable to modification—the principle of inheritance still
betraying their original birthplace.</p>
<p>Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost
universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related
to those of the nearest continent, or of the nearest large island.
The exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus,
although Kerguelen Land stands nearer to Africa than to America,
the plants are related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr.
Hooker's account, to those of America: but on the view that this
island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and
stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this
anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more
closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any
other region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is
also plainly related to South America, which, although the next
nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes
an anomaly. But this difficulty partially disappears on the view
that New Zealand, South America, and the other southern lands, have
been stocked in part from a nearly intermediate though distant
point, namely, from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed
with vegetation, during a warmer tertiary period, before the
commencement of the last Glacial period. The affinity, which,
though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the
flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of
Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this affinity is
confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be
explained.</p>
<p>The same law which has determined the relationship between the
inhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes
displayed on a small scale, but in a most interesting manner,
within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus each separate
island of the Galapagos Archipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a
marvellous one, by many distinct species; but these species are
related to each other in a very much closer manner than to the
inhabitants of the American continent, or of any other quarter of
the world. This is what might have been expected, for islands
situated so near to each other would almost necessarily receive
immigrants from the same original source, and from each other. But
how is it that many of the immigrants have been differently
modified, though only in a small degree, in islands situated within
sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same
height, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great difficulty:
but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of
considering the physical conditions of a country as the most
important; whereas it cannot be disputed that the nature of the
other species with which each has to compete, is at least as
important, and generally a far more important element of success.
Now if we look to the species which inhabit the Galapagos
Archipelago, and are likewise found in other parts of the world, we
find that they differ considerably in the several islands. This
difference might indeed have been expected if the islands have been
stocked by occasional means of transport—a seed, for instance, of
one plant having been brought to one island, and that of another
plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same
general source. Hence, when in former times an immigrant first
settled on one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from
one to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different
conditions in the different islands, for it would have to compete
with a different set of organisms; a plant, for instance, would
find the ground best-fitted for it occupied by somewhat different
species in the different islands, and would be exposed to the
attacks of somewhat different enemies. If, then, it varied, natural
selection would probably favour different varieties in the
different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet
retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see some
species spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the
same.</p>
<p>The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos
Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is
that each new species after being formed in any one island, did not
spread quickly to the other islands. But the islands, though in
sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most
cases wider than the British Channel, and there is no reason to
suppose that they have at any former period been continuously
united. The currents of the sea are rapid and deep between the
islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the
islands are far more effectually separated from each other than
they appear on a map. Nevertheless, some of the species, both of
those found in other parts of the world and of those confined to
the archipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may
infer from the present manner of distribution that they have spread
from one island to the others. But we often take, I think, an
erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species
invading each other's territory, when put into free
intercommunication. Undoubtedly, if one species has any advantage
over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part
supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own
places, both will probably hold their separate places for almost
any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species,
naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing
rapidity over wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species
would thus spread; but we should remember that the species which
become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely
allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct forms,
belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de
Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many
even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to
island, differ on the different islands; thus there are three
closely allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its own
island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to
be blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush; why
should it succeed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer
that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for
annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched than can
possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush
peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home
as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr.
Wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this
subject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto
Santo possess many distinct but representative species of
land-shells, some of which live in crevices of stone; and although
large quantities of stone are annually transported from Porto Santo
to Madeira, yet this latter island has not become colonised by the
Porto Santo species: nevertheless, both islands have been colonised
by some European land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage
over the indigenous species. From these considerations I think we
need not greatly marvel at the endemic species which inhabit the
several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not having all spread
from island to island. On the same continent, also, pre-occupation
has probably played an important part in checking the commingling
of the species which inhabit different districts with nearly the
same physical conditions. Thus, the south-east and south-west
corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and
are united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast
number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants; so it is, according
to Mr. Bates, with the butterflies and other animals inhabiting the
great, open, and continuous valley of the Amazons.</p>
<p>The same principle which governs the general character of the
inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source
whence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with
their subsequent modification, is of the widest application
throughout nature. We see this on every mountain-summit, in every
lake and marsh. For Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same
species have become widely spread during the Glacial epoch, are
related to those of the surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South
America, Alpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc.,
all strictly belonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a
mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the
surrounding lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and
marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport has
allowed the same forms to prevail throughout large portions of the
world. We see the same principle in the character of most of the
blind animals inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other
analogous facts could be given. It will, I believe, be found
universally true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so
distant, many closely allied or representative species occur, there
will likewise be found some identical species; and wherever many
closely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which
some naturalists rank as distinct species, and others as mere
varieties; these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process
of modification.</p>
<p>The relation between the power and extent of migration in
certain species, either at the present or at some former period,
and the existence at remote points of the world of closely allied
species, is shown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould
remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range
over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I can
hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though difficult of
proof. Among mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats, and
in a lesser degree in the Felidae and Canidae. We see the same rule
in the distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most
of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many of the genera in the
most distinct classes range over the world, and many of the species
have enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but that some of
the species have very wide ranges in the genera which range very
widely. Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have, on an
average, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far
the process of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties
of the same species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the
species has an immense range; but, if variation were to be carried
a little further, the two varieties would be ranked as distinct
species, and their range would be greatly reduced. Still less is it
meant, that species which have the capacity of crossing barriers
and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged
birds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget
that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing
barriers, but the more important power of being victorious in
distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. But
according to the view that all the species of a genus, though
distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descended
from a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a
general rule we do find, that some at least of the species range
very widely.</p>
<p>We should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of
ancient origin, and the species in this case will have had ample
time for dispersal and subsequent modification. There is also
reason to believe, from geological evidence, that within each great
class the lower organisms change at a slower rate than the higher;
consequently they will have had a better chance of ranging widely
and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact,
together with that of the seeds and eggs of most lowly organised
forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportal,
probably accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which
has lately been discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants,
namely, that the lower any group of organisms stands the more
widely it ranges.</p>
<p>The relations just discussed—namely, lower organisms ranging
more widely than the higher—some of the species of widely-ranging
genera themselves ranging widely—such facts, as alpine, lacustrine,
and marsh productions being generally related to those which live
on the surrounding low lands and dry lands—the striking
relationship between the inhabitants of islands and those of the
nearest mainland—the still closer relationship of the distinct
inhabitants of the islands of the same archipelago—are inexplicable
on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species,
but are explicable if we admit colonisation from the nearest or
readiest source, together with the subsequent adaptation of the
colonists to their new homes.</p>
