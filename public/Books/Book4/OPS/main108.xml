<h3 class="section_title">2. Analogical Resemblances</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We can understand, on the above views, the very important
distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive
resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this subject, and
he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance in
the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs between
dugongs and whales, and between these two orders of mammals and
fishes, are analogical. So is the resemblance between a mouse and a
shrew-mouse (Sorex), which belong to different orders; and the
still closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart, between the
mouse and a small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of Australia. These
latter resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems to me, by
adaptation for similarly active movements through thickets and
herbage, together with concealment from enemies.</p>
<p>Among insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus,
misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous
insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even with our
domestic varieties, as in the strikingly similar shape of the body
in the improved breeds of the Chinese and common pig, which are
descended from distinct species; and in the similarly thickened
stems of the common and specifically distinct Swedish turnip. The
resemblance between the greyhound and race-horse is hardly more
fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors
between widely different animals.</p>
<p>On the view of characters being of real importance for
classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can
clearly understand why analogical or adaptive characters, although
of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost
valueless to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most
distinct lines of descent, may have become adapted to similar
conditions, and thus have assumed a close external resemblance; but
such resemblances will not reveal—will rather tend to conceal their
blood-relationship. We can thus also understand the apparent
paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one
group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the
members of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of
the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are
compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for
swimming through the water; but between the the several members of
the whale family, the shape of the body and the fin-like limbs
offer characters exhibiting true affinity; for as these parts are
so nearly similar throughout the whole family, we cannot doubt that
they have been inherited from a common ancestor. So it is with
fishes.</p>
<p>Numerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite
distinct beings between single parts or organs, which have been
adapted for the same functions. A good instance is afforded by the
close resemblance of the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or
Thylacinus—animals which are widely sundered in the natural system.
But this resemblance is confined to general appearance, as in the
prominence of the canines, and in the cutting shape of the molar
teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus the dog has on each
side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two molars; while
the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars. The molars
also differ much in the two animals in relative size and structure.
The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk
dentition. Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either
case have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural
selection of successive variations; but if this be admitted in the
one case, it is unintelligible to me that it should be denied in
the other. I am glad to find that so high an authority as Professor
Flower has come to this same conclusion.</p>
<p>The extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely
different fishes possessing electric organs—of widely different
insects possessing luminous organs—and of orchids and asclepiads
having pollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head
of analogical resemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that
they were introduced as difficulties or objections to our theory.
In all such cases some fundamental difference in the growth or
development of the parts, and generally in their matured structure,
can be detected. The end gained is the same, but the means, though
appearing superficially to be the same, are essentially different.
The principle formerly alluded to under the term of ANALOGICAL
VARIATION has probably in these cases often come into play; that
is, the members of the same class, although only distantly allied,
have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that they
are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar manner;
and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural
selection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other,
independently of their direct inheritance from a common
progenitor.</p>
<p>As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted
by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar
circumstances —to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of
land, air and water—we can perhaps understand how it is that a
numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the
subgroups of distinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a
parallelism of this nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the
value of the groups in several classes (and all our experience
shows that their valuation is as yet arbitrary), could easily
extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary,
quinary, quaternary and ternary classifications have probably
arisen.</p>
<p>There is another and curious class of cases in which close
external resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar
habits of life, but has been gained for the sake of protection. I
allude to the wonderful manner in which certain butterflies
imitate, as first described by Mr. Bates, other and quite distinct
species. This excellent observer has shown that in some districts
of South America, where, for instance, an Ithomia abounds in gaudy
swarms, another butterfly, namely, a Leptalis, is often found
mingled in the same flock; and the latter so closely resembles the
Ithomia in every shade and stripe of colour, and even in the shape
of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened by collecting
during eleven years, was, though always on his guard, continually
deceived. When the mockers and the mocked are caught and compared,
they are found to be very different in essential structure, and to
belong not only to distinct genera, but often to distinct families.
Had this mimicry occurred in only one or two instances, it might
have been passed over as a strange coincidence. But, if we proceed
from a district where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another
mocking and mocked species, belonging to the same two genera,
equally close in their resemblance, may be found. Altogether no
less than ten genera are enumerated, which include species that
imitate other butterflies. The mockers and mocked always inhabit
the same region; we never find an imitator living remote from the
form which it imitates. The mockers are almost invariably rare
insects; the mocked in almost every case abounds in swarms. In the
same district in which a species of Leptalis closely imitates an
Ithomia, there are sometimes other Lepidoptera mimicking the same
Ithomia: so that in the same place, species of three genera of
butterflies and even a moth are found all closely resembling a
butterfly belonging to a fourth genus. It deserves especial notice
that many of the mimicking forms of the Leptalis, as well as of the
mimicked forms, can be shown by a graduated series to be merely
varieties of the same species; while others are undoubtedly
distinct species. But why, it may be asked, are certain forms
treated as the mimicked and others as the mimickers? Mr. Bates
satisfactorily answers this question by showing that the form which
is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to which it belongs,
while the counterfeiters have changed their dress and do not
resemble their nearest allies.</p>
<p>We are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for
certain butterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of
another and quite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of
naturalists, has nature condescended to the tricks of the stage?
Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit on the true explanation. The mocked
forms, which always abound in numbers, must habitually escape
destruction to a large extent, otherwise they could not exist in
such swarms; and a large amount of evidence has now been collected,
showing that they are distasteful to birds and other insect-
devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the other hand, that
inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and belong to
rare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some danger,
for otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies,
they would in three or four generations swarm over the whole
country. Now if a member of one of these persecuted and rare groups
were to assume a dress so like that of a well- protected species
that it continually deceived the practised eyes of an entomologist,
it would often deceive predaceous birds and insects, and thus often
escape destruction. Mr. Bates may almost be said to have actually
witnessed the process by which the mimickers have come so closely
to resemble the mimicked; for he found that some of the forms of
Leptalis which mimic so many other butterflies, varied in an
extreme degree. In one district several varieties occurred, and of
these one alone resembled, to a certain extent, the common Ithomia
of the same district. In another district there were two or three
varieties, one of which was much commoner than the others, and this
closely mocked another form of Ithomia. From facts of this nature,
Mr. Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies; and when a
variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly
inhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to
a flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of
escaping destruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is
consequently oftener preserved; "the less perfect degrees of
resemblance being generation after generation eliminated, and only
the others left to propagate their kind." So that here we have an
excellent illustration of natural selection.</p>
<p>Messrs. Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several
equally striking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay
Archipelago and Africa, and with some other insects. Mr. Wallace
has also detected one such case with birds, but we have none with
the larger quadrupeds. The much greater frequency of imitation with
insects than with other animals, is probably the consequence of
their small size; insects cannot defend themselves, excepting
indeed the kinds furnished with a sting, and I have never heard of
an instance of such kinds mocking other insects, though they are
mocked; insects cannot easily escape by flight from the larger
animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking metaphorically,
they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery and
dissimulation.</p>
<p>It should be observed that the process of imitation probably
never commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But,
starting with species already somewhat like each other, the closest
resemblance, if beneficial, could readily be gained by the above
means, and if the imitated form was subsequently and gradually
modified through any agency, the imitating form would be led along
the same track, and thus be altered to almost any extent, so that
it might ultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike
that of the other members of the family to which it belonged. There
is, however, some difficulty on this head, for it is necessary to
suppose in some cases that ancient members belonging to several
distinct groups, before they had diverged to their present extent,
accidentally resembled a member of another and protected group in a
sufficient degree to afford some slight protection, this having
given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most perfect
resemblance.</p>
