<h3 class="section_title">6. Fertility Of Varieties When Crossed,
And Of Their Mongrel Offspring, Not Universal</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be
some essential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch
as the latter, however much they may differ from each other in
external appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield
perfectly fertile offspring. With some exceptions, presently to be
given, I fully admit that this is the rule. But the subject is
surrounded by difficulties, for, looking to varieties produced
under nature, if two forms hitherto reputed to be varieties be
found in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by
most naturalists as species. For instance, the blue and red
pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as varieties, are
said by Gartner to be quite sterile when crossed, and he
consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a
circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will
assuredly have to be granted.</p>
<p>If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been
produced, under domestication, we are still involved in some doubt.
For when it is stated, for instance, that certain South American
indigenous domestic dogs do not readily unite with European dogs,
the explanation which will occur to everyone, and probably the true
one, is that they are descended from aboriginally distinct species.
Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic races,
differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance, those
of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more
especially when we reflect how many species there are, which,
though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when
intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the fertility
of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the first place, it may
be observed that the amount of external difference between two
species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so
that similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure
guide. It is certain that with species the cause lies exclusively
in differences in their sexual constitution. Now the varying
conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have
been subjected, have had so little tendency towards modifying the
reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that
we have good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine
of Pallas, namely, that such conditions generally eliminate this
tendency; so that the domesticated descendants of species, which in
their natural state probably would have been in some degree sterile
when crossed, become perfectly fertile together. With plants, so
far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards sterility between
distinct species, that in several well- authenticated cases already
alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an opposite
manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still retaining
the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other
species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility
through long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly
be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that
similar conditions long- continued should likewise induce this
tendency; though in certain cases, with species having a peculiar
constitution, sterility might occasionally be thus caused. Thus, as
I believe, we can understand why, with domesticated animals,
varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile; and
why with plants only a few such cases, immediately to be given,
have been observed.</p>
<p>The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears
to me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile
when crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural
varieties, as soon as they have been permanently modified in a
sufficient degree to take rank as species. We are far from
precisely knowing the cause; nor is this surprising, seeing how
profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the normal and abnormal
action of the reproductive system. But we can see that species,
owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors,
will have been exposed during long periods of time to more uniform
conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make a
wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild
animals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and
subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive
functions of organic beings which have always lived under natural
conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to
the influence of an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on
the other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their
domestication, were not originally highly sensitive to changes in
their conditions of life, and which can now generally resist with
undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions, might be
expected to produce varieties, which would be little liable to have
their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of
crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like
manner.</p>
<p>I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species
were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to
resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of
sterility in the few following cases, which I will briefly
abstract. The evidence is at least as good as that from which we
believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is
also derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases
consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific
distinction. Gartner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind of
maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing
near each other in his garden; and although these plants have
separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised
thirteen flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only
a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only
five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been
injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. No one, I believe,
has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species;
and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised
were themselves PERFECTLY fertile; so that even Gartner did not
venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.</p>
<p>Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which
like the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their
mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their
differences are greater. How far these experiments may be trusted,
I know not; but the forms experimented on are ranked by Sagaret,
who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility, as
varieties, and Naudin has come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first
incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of
experiments made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by
so good an observer and so hostile a witness as Gartner: namely,
that the yellow and white varieties when crossed produce less seed
than the similarly coloured varieties of the same species.
Moreover, he asserts that, when yellow and white varieties of one
species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a DISTINCT
species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the similarly
coloured flowers, than between those which are differently
coloured. Mr. Scott also has experimented on the species and
varieties of Verbascum; and although unable to confirm Gartner's
results on the crossing of the distinct species, he finds that the
dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same species yield fewer
seeds, in the proportion of eighty-six to 100, than the similarly
coloured varieties. Yet these varieties differ in no respect,
except in the colour of their flowers; and one variety can
sometimes be raised from the seed of another.</p>
<p>Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent
observer, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular
variety of the common tobacco was more fertile than the other
varieties, when crossed with a widely distinct species. He
experimented on five forms which are commonly reputed to be
varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely, by
reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly
fertile. But one of these five varieties, when used either as the
father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always
yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from
the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the
reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some
manner and in some degree modified.</p>
<p>From these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties
when crossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great
difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state
of nature, for a supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any
degree, would almost universally be ranked as a species; from man
attending only to external characters in his domestic varieties,
and from such varieties not having been exposed for very long
periods to uniform conditions of life; from these several
considerations we may conclude that fertility does not constitute a
fundamental distinction between varieties and species when crossed.
The general sterility of crossed species may safely be looked at,
not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as incidental on
changes of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.</p>
