<h3 class="section_title">4. Dispersal During The Glacial
Period</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits,
separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where
Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most
striking cases known of the same species living at distant points,
without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one
point to the other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many
plants of the same species living on the snowy regions of the Alps
or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is
far more remarkable, that the plants on the White Mountains, in the
United States of America, are all the same with those of Labrador,
and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on
the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as 1747, such
facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been
independently created at many distinct points; and we might have
remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called
vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall
immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We
have evidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and
inorganic, that, within a very recent geological period, central
Europe and North America suffered under an Arctic climate. The
ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly
than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with their scored
flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams
with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly has the
climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic
moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and
maize. Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic
boulders and scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold period.</p>
<p>The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution
of the inhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is
substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes more
readily, by supposing a new glacial period slowly to come on, and
then pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as
each more southern zone became fitted for the inhabitants of the
north, these would take the places of the former inhabitants of the
temperate regions. The latter, at the same time would travel
further and further southward, unless they were stopped by
barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains would
become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine
inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold
had reached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora,
covering the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and
Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions
of the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and
animals and these would be nearly the same with those of Europe;
for the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have
everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the
world.</p>
<p>As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat
northward, closely followed up in their retreat by the productions
of the more temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the
bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared
and thawed ground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and
the snow still further disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their
brethren were pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the
warmth had fully returned, the same species, which had lately lived
together on the European and North American lowlands, would again
be found in the arctic regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on
many isolated mountain-summits far distant from each other.</p>
<p>Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so
immensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of
Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants
of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic
forms living due north or nearly due north of them: for the first
migration when the cold came on, and the re-migration on the
returning warmth, would generally have been due south and north.
The Alpine plants, for example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr.
H.C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are
more especially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those
of the United States to Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia
to the arctic regions of that country. These views, grounded as
they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former
Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner
the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of
Europe and America, that when in other regions we find the same
species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude,
without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted
their migration across the intervening lowlands, now become too
warm for their existence.</p>
<p>As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards
backward to the north, in unison with the changing climate, they
will not have been exposed during their long migrations to any
great diversity of temperature; and as they all migrated in a body
together, their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed.
Hence, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume,
these forms will not have been liable to much modification. But
with the Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the
returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits
of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for
it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been
left on mountain ranges far distant from each other, and have
survived there ever since; they will also, in all probability, have
become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed
on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and
which during the coldest period will have been temporarily driven
down to the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently exposed
to somewhat different climatical influences. Their mutual relations
will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently they
will have been liable to modification; and they have been modified;
for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the
several great European mountain ranges, one with another, though
many of the species remain identically the same, some exist as
varieties, some as doubtful forms or sub-species and some as
distinct yet closely allied species representing each other on the
several ranges.</p>
<p>In the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the
commencement of our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic
productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at
the present day. But it is also necessary to assume that many
sub-arctic and some few temperate forms were the same round the
world, for some of the species which now exist on the lower
mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and Europe are
the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree of
uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world,
at the commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day,
the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and
New Worlds are separated from each other by the whole Atlantic
Ocean and by the northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial
period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived
further southwards than they do at present, they must have been
still more completely separated from each other by wider spaces of
ocean; so that it may well be asked how the same species could then
or previously have entered the two continents. The explanation, I
believe, lies in the nature of the climate before the commencement
of the Glacial period. At this, the newer Pliocene period, the
majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same
as now, and we have good reason to believe that the climate was
warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may suppose that the
organisms which now live under latitude 60 degrees, lived during
the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in
latitude 66-67 degrees; and that the present arctic productions
then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we
look at a terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that
there is almost continuous land from western Europe through
Siberia, to eastern America. And this continuity of the circumpolar
land, with the consequent freedom under a more favourable climate
for intermigration, will account for the supposed uniformity of the
sub-arctic and temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at
a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.</p>
<p>Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents
have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though
subjected to great oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to
extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and
still warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large
number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost
continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals,
both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards
as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of
the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants,
mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and
the United States. On this view we can understand the relationship
with very little identity, between the productions of North America
and Europe—a relationship which is highly remarkable, considering
the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the whole
Atlantic Ocean. We can further understand the singular fact
remarked on by several observers that the productions of Europe and
America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related
to each other than they are at the present time; for during these
warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will
have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge,
since rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their
inhabitants.</p>
<p>During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as
soon as the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old
Worlds, migrated south of the Polar Circle, they will have been
completely cut off from each other. This separation, as far as the
more temperate productions are concerned, must have taken place
long ages ago. As the plants and animals migrated southward, they
will have become mingled in the one great region with the native
American productions, and would have had to compete with them; and
in the other great region, with those of the Old World.
Consequently we have here everything favourable for much
modification—for far more modification than with the Alpine
productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on
the several mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and
North America. Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now
living productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old
Worlds, we find very few identical species (though Asa Gray has
lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly
supposed), but we find in every great class many forms, which some
naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct
species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which
are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.</p>
<p>As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern
migration of a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a
somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous
shores of the Polar Circle, will account, on the theory of
modification, for many closely allied forms now living in marine
areas completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the
presence of some closely allied, still existing and extinct
tertiary forms, on the eastern and western shores of temperate
North America; and the still more striking fact of many closely
allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), some
fish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the
seas of Japan—these two areas being now completely separated by the
breadth of a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.</p>
<p>These cases of close relationship in species either now or
formerly inhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of
North America, the Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands
of North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of
creation. We cannot maintain that such species have been created
alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical
conditions of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain
parts of South America with parts of South Africa or Australia, we
see countries closely similar in all their physical conditions,
with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.</p>
