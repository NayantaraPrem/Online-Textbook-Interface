<h3 class="section_title">7. A Part Developed In Any Species In An
Extraordinary Degree Or Manner, In Comparison With The Same Part In
Allied Species, Tends To Be Highly Variable</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Several years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above
effect made by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have
come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to
convince any one of the truth of the above proposition without
giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which
cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction
that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes
of error, but I hope that I have made due allowances for them. It
should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part,
however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in
one species or in a few species in comparison with the same part in
many closely allied species. Thus, the wing of the bat is a most
abnormal structure in the class of mammals; but the rule would not
apply here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it
would apply only if some one species had wings developed in a
remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same
genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary
sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term,
secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, relates to characters
which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with
the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but
more rarely to females, as they seldom offer remarkable secondary
sexual characters. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case
of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability
of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual
mannerâ€”of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that
our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly
shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly
attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this
order, and I am fully convinced that the rule almost always holds
good. I shall, in a future work, give a list of all the more
remarkable cases. I will here give only one, as it illustrates the
rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile
cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very
important structures, and they differ extremely little even in
distinct genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma,
these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification; the
homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly
unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of
the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration to state
that the varieties of the same species differ more from each other
in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the
species belonging to other distinct genera.</p>
<p>As with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting
the same country, vary extremely little, I have particularly
attended to them; and the rule certainly seems to hold good in this
class. I cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would
have seriously shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great
variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare
their relative degrees of variability.</p>
<p>When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree
or manner in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high
importance to that species: nevertheless it is in this case
eminently liable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view
that each species has been independently created, with all its
parts as we now see them, I can see no explanation. But on the view
that groups of species are descended from some other species, and
have been modified through natural selection, I think we can obtain
some light. First let me make some preliminary remarks. If, in our
domestic animals, any part or the whole animal be neglected, and no
selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the
Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a uniform
character: and the breed may be said to be degenerating. In
rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little
specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic
groups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases natural
selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus
the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here
more particularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic
animals, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by
continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look
at the individuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a
prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers,
in the beak and wattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of
fantails, etc., these being the points now mainly attended to by
English fanciers. Even in the same sub-breed, as in that of the
short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to breed nearly
perfect birds, many departing widely from the standard. There may
truly be said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the
one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect state, as
well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the other
hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the
long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so
completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon
from a good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly
going on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may
always be expected.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other
species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has
undergone an extraordinary amount of modification since the period
when the several species branched off from the common progenitor of
the genus. This period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree,
as species rarely endure for more than one geological period. An
extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and
long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been
accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species.
But as the variability of the extraordinarily developed part or
organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not
excessively remote, we might, as a general rule, still expect to
find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the
organisation which have remained for a much longer period nearly
constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case. That the struggle
between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to
reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of
time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be
made constant, I see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ,
however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately
the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of
the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to our theory,
for an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it has
come not to be more variable than any other structure. It is only
in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively
recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the
GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called, still present in a
high degree. For in this case the variability will seldom as yet
have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals
varying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued
rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified
condition.</p>
