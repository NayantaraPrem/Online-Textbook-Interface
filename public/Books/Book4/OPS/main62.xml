<p>Many instincts are so wonderful that their development will
probably appear to the reader a difficulty sufficient to overthrow
my whole theory. I may here premise, that I have nothing to do with
the origin of the mental powers, any more than I have with that of
life itself. We are concerned only with the diversities of instinct
and of the other mental faculties in animals of the same class.</p>
<p>I will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy
to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced
by this term; but every one understands what is meant, when it is
said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs
in other birds' nests. An action, which we ourselves require
experience to enable us to perform, when performed by an animal,
more especially by a very young one, without experience, and when
performed by many individuals in the same way, without their
knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually said to be
instinctive. But I could show that none of these characters are
universal. A little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre Huber
expresses it, often comes into play, even with animals low in the
scale of nature.</p>
<p>Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have
compared instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, an
accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive
action is performed, but not necessarily of its origin. How
unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not
rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be
modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become associated
with other habits, with certain periods of time and states of the
body. When once acquired, they often remain constant throughout
life. Several other points of resemblance between instincts and
habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song, so
in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a
person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote,
he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of
thought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a
very complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had
completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction,
and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the
caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages
of construction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a
hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put
into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work
was already done for it, far from deriving any benefit from this,
it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock,
seemed forced to start from the third stage, where it had left off,
and thus tried to complete the already finished work.</p>
<p>If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited—and it can
be shown that this does sometimes happen—then the resemblance
between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so
close as not to be distinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the
pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice, had
played a tune with no practice at all, be might truly be said to
have done so instinctively. But it would be a serious error to
suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by
habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance to
succeeding generations. It can be clearly shown that the most
wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of
the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been
acquired by habit.</p>
<p>It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important
as corporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its
present conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is
at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be
profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do
vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural
selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of
instinct to any extent that was profitable. It is thus, as I
believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have
originated. As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and
are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by
disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with instincts. But I believe
that the effects of habit are in many cases of subordinate
importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be
called spontaneous variations of instincts;—that is of variations
produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations
of bodily structure.</p>
<p>No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural
selection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous,
slight, yet profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of
corporeal structures, we ought to find in nature, not the actual
transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been
acquired—for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of
each species—but we ought to find in the collateral lines of
descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at least to
be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this
we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find, making
allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little
observed, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct
being known among extinct species, how very generally gradations,
leading to the most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes
of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having
different instincts at different periods of life, or at different
seasons of the year, or when placed under different circumstances,
etc.; in which case either the one or the other instinct might be
preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity of
instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.</p>
<p>Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to
my theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has
never, as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good
of others. One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently
performing an action for the sole good of another, with which I am
acquainted, is that of aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first
observed by Huber, their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so
voluntarily, the following facts show. I removed all the ants from
a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented
their attendance during several hours. After this interval, I felt
sure that the aphides would want to excrete. I watched them for
some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I then tickled and
stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as
the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted. Afterwards,
I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its
eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it
had discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the
abdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each, as soon
as it felt the antennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and
excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured
by the ant. Even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner,
showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of
experience. It is certain, from the observations of Huber, that the
aphides show no dislike to the ants: if the latter be not present
they are at last compelled to eject their excretion. But as the
excretion is extremely viscid, it is no doubt a convenience to the
aphides to have it removed; therefore probably they do not excrete
solely for the good of the ants. Although there is no evidence that
any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of another
species, yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of
others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of
other species. So again certain instincts cannot be considered as
absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points
are not indispensable, they may be here passed over.</p>
<p>As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of
nature, and the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable
for the action of natural selection, as many instances as possible
ought to be given; but want of space prevents me. I can only assert
that instincts certainly do vary—for instance, the migratory
instinct, both in extent and direction, and in its total loss. So
it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly in dependence on
the situations chosen, and on the nature and temperature of the
country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown to us.
Audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the
nests of the same species in the northern and southern United
States. Why, it has been asked, if instinct be variable, has it not
granted to the bee "the ability to use some other material when wax
was deficient?" But what other natural material could bees use?
They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with vermilion or
softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees, instead
of laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and
turpentine, with which he had covered decorticated trees. It has
lately been shown that bees, instead of searching for pollen, will
gladly use a very different substance, namely, oatmeal. Fear of any
particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be
seen in nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience,
and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. The
fear of man is slowly acquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by the
various animals which inhabit desert islands; and we see an
instance of this, even in England, in the greater wildness of all
our large birds in comparison with our small birds; for the large
birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely attribute the
greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in
uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small;
and the magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the
hooded crow in Egypt.</p>
<p>That the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a
state of nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts. Several
cases could also be adduced of occasional and strange habits in
wild animals, which, if advantageous to the species, might have
given rise, through natural selection, to new instincts. But I am
well aware that these general statements, without the facts in
detail, can produce but a feeble effect on the reader's mind. I can
only repeat my assurance, that I do not speak without good
evidence.</p>
