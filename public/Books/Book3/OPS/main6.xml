<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,
MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind
unseen</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,<br />
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,<br />
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,<br />
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where's Peaseblossom?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PEASEBLOSSOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur
Cobweb?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COBWEB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your<br />
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped<br />
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good<br />
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret<br />
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,<br />
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;<br />
I would be loath to have you overflown with a<br />
honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,<br />
leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's your Will?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb<br />
to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for<br />
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I<br />
am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,<br />
I must scratch.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, wilt thou hear some music,<br />
my sweet love?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have<br />
the tongs and the bones.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good<br />
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle<br />
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a venturous fairy that shall seek<br />
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.<br />
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I<br />
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.<br />
Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt fairies</em></p>
<p>So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle<br />
Gently entwist; the female ivy so<br />
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.<br />
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!<br /></p>
<p><em>They sleep</em></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.<br />
See'st thou this sweet sight?<br />
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:<br />
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,<br />
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,<br />
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;<br />
For she his hairy temples then had rounded<br />
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;<br />
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<br />
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<br />
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes<br />
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.<br />
When I had at my pleasure taunted her<br />
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,<br />
I then did ask of her her changeling child;<br />
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<br />
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.<br />
And now I have the boy, I will undo<br />
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:<br />
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp<br />
From off the head of this Athenian swain;<br />
That, he awaking when the other do,<br />
May all to Athens back again repair<br />
And think no more of this night's accidents<br />
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.<br />
But first I will release the fairy queen.<br />
Be as thou wast wont to be;<br />
See as thou wast wont to see:<br />
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower<br />
Hath such force and blessed power.<br />
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Oberon! what visions have I seen!<br />
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There lies your love.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How came these things to pass?<br />
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.<br />
Titania, music call; and strike more dead<br />
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!<br /></p>
<p><em>Music, still</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, when thou wakest, with thine<br />
own fool's eyes peep.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,<br />
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.<br />
Now thou and I are new in amity,<br />
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly<br />
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,<br />
And bless it to all fair prosperity:<br />
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be<br />
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy king, attend, and mark:<br />
I do hear the morning lark.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, my queen, in silence sad,<br />
Trip we after the night's shade:<br />
We the globe can compass soon,<br />
Swifter than the wandering moon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, my lord, and in our flight<br />
Tell me how it came this night<br />
That I sleeping here was found<br />
With these mortals on the ground.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Horns winded within</em></p>
<p><em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, one of you, find out the forester;<br />
For now our observation is perform'd;<br />
And since we have the vaward of the day,<br />
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.<br />
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:<br />
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<p>We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,<br />
And mark the musical confusion<br />
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,<br />
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear<br />
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear<br />
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,<br />
The skies, the fountains, every region near<br />
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard<br />
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,<br />
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung<br />
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;<br />
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;<br />
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,<br />
Each under each. A cry more tuneable<br />
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,<br />
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:<br />
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;<br />
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;<br />
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:<br />
I wonder of their being here together.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No doubt they rose up early to observe<br />
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,<br />
Came here in grace our solemnity.<br />
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day<br />
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.<br /></p>
<p><em>Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and
HERMIA wake and start up</em></p>
<p>Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:<br />
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pardon, my lord.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you all, stand up.<br />
I know you two are rival enemies:<br />
How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br />
That hatred is so far from jealousy,<br />
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,<br />
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,<br />
I cannot truly say how I came here;<br />
But, as I think,—for truly would I speak,<br />
And now do I bethink me, so it is,—<br />
I came with Hermia hither: our intent<br />
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,<br />
Without the peril of the Athenian law.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:<br />
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.<br />
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,<br />
Thereby to have defeated you and me,<br />
You of your wife and me of my consent,<br />
Of my consent that she should be your wife.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<br />
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;<br />
And I in fury hither follow'd them,<br />
Fair Helena in fancy following me.<br />
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,—<br />
But by some power it is,—my love to Hermia,<br />
Melted as the snow, seems to me now<br />
As the remembrance of an idle gaud<br />
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;<br />
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,<br />
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,<br />
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,<br />
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:<br />
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;<br />
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,<br />
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,<br />
And will for evermore be true to it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:<br />
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.<br />
Egeus, I will overbear your will;<br />
For in the temple by and by with us<br />
These couples shall eternally be knit:<br />
And, for the morning now is something worn,<br />
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.<br />
Away with us to Athens; three and three,<br />
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.<br />
Come, Hippolyta.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These things seem small and undistinguishable,<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Methinks I see these things with parted eye,<br />
When every thing seems double.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So methinks:<br />
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,<br />
Mine own, and not mine own.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you sure<br />
That we are awake? It seems to me<br />
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think<br />
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea; and my father.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Hippolyta.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he did bid us follow to the temple.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him<br />
And by the way let us recount our dreams.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will<br />
answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!<br />
Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,<br />
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen<br />
hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare<br />
vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to<br />
say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go<br />
about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there<br />
is no man can tell what. Methought I was,—and<br />
methought I had,—but man is but a patched fool, if<br />
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye<br />
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not<br />
seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue<br />
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream<br />
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of<br />
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,<br />
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the<br />
latter end of a play, before the duke:<br />
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall<br />
sing it at her death.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
