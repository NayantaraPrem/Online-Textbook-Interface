<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
STARVELING</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are we all met?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place<br />
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our<br />
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we<br />
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Quince,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and<br />
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must<br />
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies<br />
cannot abide. How answer you that?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>STARVELING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
done.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.<br />
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to<br />
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that<br />
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more<br />
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not<br />
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them<br />
out of fear.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be<br />
written in eight and six.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and
eight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>STARVELING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fear it, I promise you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to<br />
bring in—God shield us!—a lion among ladies, is a<br />
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful<br />
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to<br />
look to 't.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must<br />
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself<br />
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same<br />
defect,—'Ladies,'—or 'Fair-ladies—I would wish<br />
You,'—or 'I would request you,'—or 'I would<br />
entreat you,—not to fear, not to tremble: my life<br />
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it<br />
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a<br />
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name<br />
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;<br />
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,<br />
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find<br />
out moonshine, find out moonshine.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it doth shine that night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great<br />
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon<br />
may shine in at the casement.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns<br />
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to<br />
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is<br />
another thing: we must have a wall in the great<br />
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did<br />
talk through the chink of a wall.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him<br />
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast<br />
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his<br />
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus<br />
and Thisby whisper.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,<br />
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.<br />
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your<br />
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one<br />
according to his cue.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK behind</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,<br />
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?<br />
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;<br />
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odours, odours.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>—odours savours sweet:<br />
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.<br />
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,<br />
And by and by I will to thee appear.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Must I speak now?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes<br />
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,<br />
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,<br />
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,<br />
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,<br />
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that<br />
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your<br />
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue<br />
is past; it is, 'never tire.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O,—As true as truest horse, that yet would<br />
never tire.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,<br />
masters! fly, masters! Help!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,<br />
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:<br />
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,<br />
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;<br />
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,<br />
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to<br />
make me afeard.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter SNOUT</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do<br />
you?<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit SNOUT</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter QUINCE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art<br />
translated.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;<br />
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir<br />
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up<br />
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear<br />
I am not afraid.<br /></p>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<p>The ousel cock so black of hue,<br />
With orange-tawny bill,<br />
The throstle with his note so true,<br />
The wren with little quill,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Sings]<br />
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,<br />
The plain-song cuckoo gray,<br />
Whose note full many a man doth mark,<br />
And dares not answer nay;—<br />
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish<br />
a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry<br />
'cuckoo' never so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:<br />
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;<br />
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;<br />
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me<br />
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason<br />
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and<br />
love keep little company together now-a-days; the<br />
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not<br />
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out<br />
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of this wood do not desire to go:<br />
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.<br />
I am a spirit of no common rate;<br />
The summer still doth tend upon my state;<br />
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;<br />
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,<br />
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,<br />
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;<br />
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so<br />
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.<br />
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PEASEBLOSSOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COBWEB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MOTH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where shall we go?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;<br />
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;<br />
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,<br />
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;<br />
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,<br />
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs<br />
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,<br />
To have my love to bed and to arise;<br />
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies<br />
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:<br />
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PEASEBLOSSOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail, mortal!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COBWEB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MOTH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your<br />
worship's name.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COBWEB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cobweb.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master<br />
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with<br />
you. Your name, honest gentleman?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PEASEBLOSSOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peaseblossom.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your<br />
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good<br />
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more<br />
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mustardseed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:<br />
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath<br />
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise<br />
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I<br />
desire your more acquaintance, good Master<br />
Mustardseed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.<br />
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;<br />
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,<br />
Lamenting some enforced chastity.<br />
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
