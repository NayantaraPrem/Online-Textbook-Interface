<h3 class="section_title">SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
STARVELING</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is all our company here?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You were best to call them generally, man by man,<br />
according to the scrip.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is<br />
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our<br />
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his<br />
wedding-day at night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats<br />
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow<br />
to a point.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and<br />
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a<br />
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your<br />
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That will ask some tears in the true performing of<br />
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their<br />
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some<br />
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a<br />
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to<br />
tear a cat in, to make all split.<br />
The raging rocks<br />
And shivering shocks<br />
Shall break the locks<br />
Of prison gates;<br />
And Phibbus' car<br />
Shall shine from far<br />
And make and mar<br />
The foolish Fates.<br />
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.<br />
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is<br />
more condoling.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard
coming.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and<br />
you may speak as small as you will.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll<br />
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,<br />
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,<br />
and lady dear!'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, proceed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robin Starveling, the tailor.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>STARVELING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.<br />
Tom Snout, the tinker.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNOUT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:<br />
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I<br />
hope, here is a play fitted.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNUG</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it<br />
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
roaring.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will<br />
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,<br />
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,<br />
let him roar again.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright<br />
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;<br />
and that were enough to hang us all.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ALL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That would hang us, every mother's son.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the<br />
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more<br />
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my<br />
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any<br />
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any<br />
nightingale.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a<br />
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a<br />
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:<br />
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best<br />
to play it in?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, what you will.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour<br />
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain<br />
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your<br />
perfect yellow.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and<br />
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here<br />
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request<br />
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;<br />
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the<br />
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if<br />
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with<br />
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I<br />
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play<br />
wants. I pray you, fail me not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will meet; and there we may rehearse most<br />
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect:
adieu.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the duke's oak we meet.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
