<p><em>Enter OBERON</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Titania be awaked;<br />
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,<br />
Which she must dote on in extremity.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
<p>Here comes my messenger.<br />
How now, mad spirit!<br />
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mistress with a monster is in love.<br />
Near to her close and consecrated bower,<br />
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,<br />
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,<br />
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,<br />
Were met together to rehearse a play<br />
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.<br />
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<br />
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport<br />
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake<br />
When I did him at this advantage take,<br />
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:<br />
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,<br />
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,<br />
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,<br />
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,<br />
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,<br />
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,<br />
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;<br />
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;<br />
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.<br />
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears<br />
thus strong,<br />
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;<br />
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;<br />
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all<br />
things catch.<br />
I led them on in this distracted fear,<br />
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:<br />
When in that moment, so it came to pass,<br />
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This falls out better than I could devise.<br />
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes<br />
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took him sleeping,—that is finish'd too,—<br />
And the Athenian woman by his side:<br />
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stand close: this is the same Athenian.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the woman, but not this the man.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?<br />
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,<br />
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,<br />
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,<br />
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,<br />
And kill me too.<br />
The sun was not so true unto the day<br />
As he to me: would he have stolen away<br />
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon<br />
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon<br />
May through the centre creep and so displease<br />
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.<br />
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;<br />
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So should the murder'd look, and so should I,<br />
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:<br />
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,<br />
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's this to my Lysander? where is he?<br />
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds<br />
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?<br />
Henceforth be never number'd among men!<br />
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!<br />
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,<br />
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!<br />
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?<br />
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue<br />
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You spend your passion on a misprised mood:<br />
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;<br />
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An if I could, what should I get therefore?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A privilege never to see me more.<br />
And from thy hated presence part I so:<br />
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no following her in this fierce vein:<br />
Here therefore for a while I will remain.<br />
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow<br />
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:<br />
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<br />
If for his tender here I make some stay.<br /></p>
<p><em>Lies down and sleeps</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite<br />
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:<br />
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue<br />
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,<br />
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>About the wood go swifter than the wind,<br />
And Helena of Athens look thou find:<br />
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,<br />
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:<br />
By some illusion see thou bring her here:<br />
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I go, I go; look how I go,<br />
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flower of this purple dye,<br />
Hit with Cupid's archery,<br />
Sink in apple of his eye.<br />
When his love he doth espy,<br />
Let her shine as gloriously<br />
As the Venus of the sky.<br />
When thou wakest, if she be by,<br />
Beg of her for remedy.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Captain of our fairy band,<br />
Helena is here at hand;<br />
And the youth, mistook by me,<br />
Pleading for a lover's fee.<br />
Shall we their fond pageant see?<br />
Lord, what fools these mortals be!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stand aside: the noise they make<br />
Will cause Demetrius to awake.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then will two at once woo one;<br />
That must needs be sport alone;<br />
And those things do best please me<br />
That befal preposterously.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LYSANDER and HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?<br />
Scorn and derision never come in tears:<br />
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,<br />
In their nativity all truth appears.<br />
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,<br />
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do advance your cunning more and more.<br />
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!<br />
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?<br />
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:<br />
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,<br />
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had no judgment when to her I swore.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!<br />
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?<br />
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show<br />
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<br />
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,<br />
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow<br />
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss<br />
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent<br />
To set against me for your merriment:<br />
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,<br />
You would not do me thus much injury.<br />
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<br />
But you must join in souls to mock me too?<br />
If you were men, as men you are in show,<br />
You would not use a gentle lady so;<br />
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,<br />
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br />
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;<br />
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:<br />
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<br />
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes<br />
With your derision! none of noble sort<br />
Would so offend a virgin, and extort<br />
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;<br />
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:<br />
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,<br />
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;<br />
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,<br />
Whom I do love and will do till my death.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never did mockers waste more idle breath.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:<br />
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.<br />
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,<br />
And now to Helen is it home return'd,<br />
There to remain.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Helen, it is not so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<br />
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.<br />
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,<br />
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;<br />
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,<br />
It pays the hearing double recompense.<br />
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;<br />
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound<br />
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What love could press Lysander from my side?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,<br />
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night<br />
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.<br />
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,<br />
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You speak not as you think: it cannot be.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!<br />
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three<br />
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.<br />
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!<br />
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived<br />
To bait me with this foul derision?<br />
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<br />
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,<br />
When we have chid the hasty-footed time<br />
For parting us,—O, is it all forgot?<br />
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?<br />
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br />
Have with our needles created both one flower,<br />
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br />
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br />
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,<br />
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,<br />
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br />
But yet an union in partition;<br />
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;<br />
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;<br />
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<br />
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<br />
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,<br />
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br />
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:<br />
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br />
Though I alone do feel the injury.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am amazed at your passionate words.<br />
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,<br />
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?<br />
And made your other love, Demetrius,<br />
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,<br />
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,<br />
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this<br />
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander<br />
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,<br />
And tender me, forsooth, affection,<br />
But by your setting on, by your consent?<br />
What thought I be not so in grace as you,<br />
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,<br />
But miserable most, to love unloved?<br />
This you should pity rather than despise.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERNIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand not what you mean by this.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,<br />
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;<br />
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:<br />
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.<br />
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,<br />
You would not make me such an argument.<br />
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;<br />
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:<br />
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O excellent!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet, do not scorn her so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If she cannot entreat, I can compel.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:<br />
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.<br />
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:<br />
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,<br />
To prove him false that says I love thee not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I say I love thee more than he can do.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick, come!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lysander, whereto tends all this?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Away, you Ethiope!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, no; he'll [ ]<br />
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,<br />
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!<br /></p>

<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,<br />
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?<br />
Sweet love,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!<br />
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you not jest?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, sooth; and so do you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would I had your bond, for I perceive<br />
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<br />
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, can you do me greater harm than hate?<br />
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!<br />
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?<br />
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.<br />
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left<br />
me:<br />
Why, then you left me—O, the gods forbid!—<br />
In earnest, shall I say?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, by my life;<br />
And never did desire to see thee more.<br />
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<br />
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest<br />
That I do hate thee and love Helena.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!<br />
You thief of love! what, have you come by night<br />
And stolen my love's heart from him?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine, i'faith!<br />
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br />
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear<br />
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br />
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.<br />
Now I perceive that she hath made compare<br />
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;<br />
And with her personage, her tall personage,<br />
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.<br />
And are you grown so high in his esteem;<br />
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<br />
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;<br />
How low am I? I am not yet so low<br />
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,<br />
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;<br />
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;<br />
I am a right maid for my cowardice:<br />
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,<br />
Because she is something lower than myself,<br />
That I can match her.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lower! hark, again.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.<br />
I evermore did love you, Hermia,<br />
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;<br />
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,<br />
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.<br />
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;<br />
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me<br />
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:<br />
And now, so you will let me quiet go,<br />
To Athens will I bear my folly back<br />
And follow you no further: let me go:<br />
You see how simple and how fond I am.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>

<p>A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.<br /></p>

<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>

<p>O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!<br />
She was a vixen when she went to school;<br />
And though she be but little, she is fierce.<br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!<br />

You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;<br />
You bead, you acorn.<br /></p>

<p>You are too officious<br />
In her behalf that scorns your services.<br />
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;<br />
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend<br />
Never so little show of love to her,<br />
Thou shalt aby it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now she holds me not;<br />
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,<br />
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.<br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS</em></p>

<p>I will not trust you, I,<br />
Nor longer stay in your curst company.<br />

My legs are longer though, to run away.<br /></p>

Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.<br />
Did not you tell me I should know the man<br />
By the Athenian garment be had on?<br />
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,<br />

And so far am I glad it so did sort<br />
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.<br /></p>

<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:<br />
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;<br />
The starry welkin cover thou anon<br />
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,<br />
And lead these testy rivals so astray<br />
As one come not within another's way.<br />
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,<br />
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;<br />
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;<br />
And from each other look thou lead them thus,<br />
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep<br />
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:<br />
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;<br />
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,<br />
To take from thence all error with his might,<br />
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.<br />
When they next wake, all this derision<br />
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,<br />
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,<br />
With league whose date till death shall never end.<br />
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<br />
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;<br />
And then I will her charmed eye release<br />
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,<br />
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,<br />
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;<br />
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,<br />
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,<br />
That in crossways and floods have burial,<br />
Already to their wormy beds are gone;<br />
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,<br />
They willfully themselves exile from light<br />
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we are spirits of another sort:<br />
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,<br />
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,<br />
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,<br />
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,<br />
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.<br />
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:<br />
We may effect this business yet ere day.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up and down, up and down,<br />
I will lead them up and down:<br />
I am fear'd in field and town:<br />
Goblin, lead them up and down.<br />
Here comes one.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter LYSANDER</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be with thee straight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow me, then,<br />
To plainer ground.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lysander! speak again:<br />
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?<br />
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,<br />
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,<br />
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;<br />
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled<br />
That draws a sword on thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, art thou there?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter LYSANDER</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He goes before me and still dares me on:<br />
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.<br />
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:<br />
I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;<br />
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,<br />
And here will rest me.<br /></p>
<p><em>Lies down</em></p>
<p>Come, thou gentle day!<br />
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,<br />
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.<br /></p>
<p><em>Sleeps</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot<br />
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,<br />
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.<br />
Where art thou now?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come hither: I am here.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,<br />
If ever I thy face by daylight see:<br />
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me<br />
To measure out my length on this cold bed.<br />
By day's approach look to be visited.<br /></p>
<p><em>Lies down and sleeps</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O weary night, O long and tedious night,<br />
Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,<br />
That I may back to Athens by daylight,<br />
From these that my poor company detest:<br />
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,<br />
Steal me awhile from mine own company.<br /></p>
<p><em>Lies down and sleeps</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet but three? Come one more;<br />
Two of both kinds make up four.<br />
Here she comes, curst and sad:<br />
Cupid is a knavish lad,<br />
Thus to make poor females mad.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never so weary, never so in woe,<br />
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,<br />
I can no further crawl, no further go;<br />
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.<br />
Here will I rest me till the break of day.<br />
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!<br /></p>
<p><em>Lies down and sleeps</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the ground<br />
Sleep sound:<br />
I'll apply<br />
To your eye,<br />
Gentle lover, remedy.<br /></p>
<p><em>Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes</em></p>
<p>When thou wakest,<br />
Thou takest<br />
True delight<br />
In the sight<br />
Of thy former lady's eye:<br />
And the country proverb known,<br />
That every man should take his own,<br />
In your waking shall be shown:<br />
Jack shall have Jill;<br />
Nought shall go ill;<br />
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
