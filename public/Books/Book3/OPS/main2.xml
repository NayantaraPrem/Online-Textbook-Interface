<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How now, spirit! whither wander you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over hill, over dale,<br />
Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br />
Over park, over pale,<br />
Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br />
I do wander everywhere,<br />
Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br />
And I serve the fairy queen,<br />
To dew her orbs upon the green.<br />
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<br />
In their gold coats spots you see;<br />
Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br />
In those freckles live their savours:<br />
I must go seek some dewdrops here<br />
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<br />
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<br />
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br />
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br />
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br />
Because that she as her attendant hath<br />
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br />
She never had so sweet a changeling;<br />
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br />
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br />
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br />
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br />
And now they never meet in grove or green,<br />
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br />
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br />
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br />
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br />
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he<br />
That frights the maidens of the villagery;<br />
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern<br />
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;<br />
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;<br />
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<br />
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,<br />
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:<br />
Are not you he?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou speak'st aright;<br />
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br />
I jest to Oberon and make him smile<br />
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br />
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:<br />
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,<br />
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br />
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob<br />
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.<br />
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br />
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br />
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br />
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;<br />
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,<br />
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear<br />
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br />
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the
other, TITANIA, with hers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:<br />
I have forsworn his bed and company.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I must be thy lady: but I know<br />
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,<br />
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,<br />
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love<br />
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<br />
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?<br />
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<br />
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,<br />
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come<br />
To give their bed joy and prosperity.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,<br />
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<br />
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<br />
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night<br />
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?<br />
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,<br />
With Ariadne and Antiopa?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are the forgeries of jealousy:<br />
And never, since the middle summer's spring,<br />
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<br />
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,<br />
Or in the beached margent of the sea,<br />
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br />
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.<br />
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br />
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea<br />
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land<br />
Have every pelting river made so proud<br />
That they have overborne their continents:<br />
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,<br />
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br />
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;<br />
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br />
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br />
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,<br />
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green<br />
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:<br />
The human mortals want their winter here;<br />
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:<br />
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br />
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br />
That rheumatic diseases do abound:<br />
And thorough this distemperature we see<br />
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br />
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,<br />
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown<br />
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br />
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,<br />
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br />
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,<br />
By their increase, now knows not which is which:<br />
And this same progeny of evils comes<br />
From our debate, from our dissension;<br />
We are their parents and original.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:<br />
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br />
I do but beg a little changeling boy,<br />
To be my henchman.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set your heart at rest:<br />
The fairy land buys not the child of me.<br />
His mother was a votaress of my order:<br />
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,<br />
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,<br />
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,<br />
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,<br />
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive<br />
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br />
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait<br />
Following,—her womb then rich with my young squire,—<br />
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<br />
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<br />
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br />
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;<br />
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br />
And for her sake I will not part with him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long within this wood intend you stay?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.<br />
If you will patiently dance in our round<br />
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<br />
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!<br />
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit TITANIA with her train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove<br />
Till I torment thee for this injury.<br />
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest<br />
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br />
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back<br />
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br />
That the rude sea grew civil at her song<br />
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,<br />
To hear the sea-maid's music.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,<br />
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br />
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took<br />
At a fair vestal throned by the west,<br />
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,<br />
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;<br />
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft<br />
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,<br />
And the imperial votaress passed on,<br />
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br />
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br />
It fell upon a little western flower,<br />
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,<br />
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.<br />
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:<br />
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid<br />
Will make or man or woman madly dote<br />
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br />
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again<br />
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll put a girdle round about the earth<br />
In forty minutes.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having once this juice,<br />
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,<br />
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.<br />
The next thing then she waking looks upon,<br />
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,<br />
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,<br />
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:<br />
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,<br />
As I can take it with another herb,<br />
I'll make her render up her page to me.<br />
But who comes here? I am invisible;<br />
And I will overhear their conference.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.<br />
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<br />
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.<br />
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;<br />
And here am I, and wode within this wood,<br />
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<br />
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;<br />
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<br />
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,<br />
And I shall have no power to follow you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?<br />
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth<br />
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And even for that do I love you the more.<br />
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,<br />
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:<br />
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,<br />
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,<br />
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.<br />
What worser place can I beg in your love,—<br />
And yet a place of high respect with me,—<br />
Than to be used as you use your dog?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;<br />
For I am sick when I do look on thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I am sick when I look not on you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do impeach your modesty too much,<br />
To leave the city and commit yourself<br />
Into the hands of one that loves you not;<br />
To trust the opportunity of night<br />
And the ill counsel of a desert place<br />
With the rich worth of your virginity.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your virtue is my privilege: for that<br />
It is not night when I do see your face,<br />
Therefore I think I am not in the night;<br />
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<br />
For you in my respect are all the world:<br />
Then how can it be said I am alone,<br />
When all the world is here to look on me?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,<br />
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<br />
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:<br />
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;<br />
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind<br />
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,<br />
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not stay thy questions; let me go:<br />
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe<br />
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,<br />
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<br />
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:<br />
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;<br />
We should be wood and were not made to woo.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit DEMETRIUS</em></p>
<p>I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,<br />
To die upon the hand I love so well.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,<br />
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK</em></p>
<p>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, there it is.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray thee, give it me.<br />
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br />
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br />
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br />
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<br />
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br />
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;<br />
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,<br />
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:<br />
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,<br />
And make her full of hateful fantasies.<br />
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:<br />
A sweet Athenian lady is in love<br />
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;<br />
But do it when the next thing he espies<br />
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man<br />
By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br />
Effect it with some care, that he may prove<br />
More fond on her than she upon her love:<br />
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
