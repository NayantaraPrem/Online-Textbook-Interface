<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and
Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tis strange my Theseus, that these<br />
lovers speak of.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More strange than true: I never may believe<br />
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.<br />
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,<br />
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend<br />
More than cool reason ever comprehends.<br />
The lunatic, the lover and the poet<br />
Are of imagination all compact:<br />
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,<br />
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,<br />
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:<br />
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,<br />
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br />
And as imagination bodies forth<br />
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<br />
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing<br />
A local habitation and a name.<br />
Such tricks hath strong imagination,<br />
That if it would but apprehend some joy,<br />
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;<br />
Or in the night, imagining some fear,<br />
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But all the story of the night told over,<br />
And all their minds transfigured so together,<br />
More witnesseth than fancy's images<br />
And grows to something of great constancy;<br />
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA</em></p>
<p>Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love<br />
Accompany your hearts!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than to us<br />
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,<br />
To wear away this long age of three hours<br />
Between our after-supper and bed-time?<br />
Where is our usual manager of mirth?<br />
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,<br />
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?<br />
Call Philostrate.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, mighty Theseus.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?<br />
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile<br />
The lazy time, if not with some delight?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a brief how many sports are ripe:<br />
Make choice of which your highness will see first.<br /></p>
<p><em>Giving a paper</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung<br />
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'<br />
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,<br />
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.<br /></p>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<p>'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,<br />
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'<br />
That is an old device; and it was play'd<br />
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.<br /></p>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<p>'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death<br />
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'<br />
That is some satire, keen and critical,<br />
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.<br /></p>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<p>'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus<br />
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'<br />
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!<br />
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.<br />
How shall we find the concord of this discord?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,<br />
Which is as brief as I have known a play;<br />
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,<br />
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play<br />
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:<br />
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;<br />
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.<br />
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,<br />
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears<br />
The passion of loud laughter never shed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are they that do play it?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,<br />
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,<br />
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories<br />
With this same play, against your nuptial.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we will hear it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, my noble lord;<br />
It is not for you: I have heard it over,<br />
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;<br />
Unless you can find sport in their intents,<br />
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,<br />
To do you service.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will hear that play;<br />
For never anything can be amiss,<br />
When simpleness and duty tender it.<br />
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit PHILOSTRATE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged<br />
And duty in his service perishing.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He says they can do nothing in this kind.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.<br />
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:<br />
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect<br />
Takes it in might, not merit.<br />
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed<br />
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;<br />
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,<br />
Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br />
Throttle their practised accent in their fears<br />
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,<br />
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,<br />
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;<br />
And in the modesty of fearful duty<br />
I read as much as from the rattling tongue<br />
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br />
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity<br />
In least speak most, to my capacity.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PHILOSTRATE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let him approach.<br /></p>
<p><em>Flourish of trumpets</em></p>
<p><em>Enter QUINCE for the Prologue</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we offend, it is with our good will.<br />
That you should think, we come not to offend,<br />
But with good will. To show our simple skill,<br />
That is the true beginning of our end.<br />
Consider then we come but in despite.<br />
We do not come as minding to contest you,<br />
Our true intent is. All for your delight<br />
We are not here. That you should here repent you,<br />
The actors are at hand and by their show<br />
You shall know all that you are like to know.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fellow doth not stand upon points.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows<br />
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not<br />
enough to speak, but to speak true.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child<br />
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing<br />
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;<br />
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<br />
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;<br />
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.<br />
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present<br />
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;<br />
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content<br />
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.<br />
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,<br />
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,<br />
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<br />
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.<br />
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,<br />
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,<br />
Did scare away, or rather did affright;<br />
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,<br />
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<br />
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,<br />
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:<br />
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<br />
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;<br />
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,<br />
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br />
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain<br />
At large discourse, while here they do remain.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the lion be to speak.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Wall</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this same interlude it doth befall<br />
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;<br />
And such a wall, as I would have you think,<br />
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,<br />
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,<br />
Did whisper often very secretly.<br />
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show<br />
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:<br />
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,<br />
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard<br />
discourse, my lord.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Pyramus</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!<br />
O night, which ever art when day is not!<br />
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,<br />
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!<br />
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,<br />
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!<br />
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,<br />
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!<br /></p>
<p><em>Wall holds up his fingers</em></p>
<p>Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!<br />
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.<br />
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!<br />
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse
again.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'<br />
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to<br />
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will<br />
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Thisbe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,<br />
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!<br />
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,<br />
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see a voice: now will I to the chink,<br />
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My love thou art, my love I think.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;<br />
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Wall</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;<br />
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear<br />
without warning.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst<br />
are no worse, if imagination amend them.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we imagine no worse of them than they of<br />
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here<br />
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Lion and Moonshine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear<br />
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,<br />
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,<br />
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.<br />
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am<br />
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;<br />
For, if I should as lion come in strife<br />
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lion is a very fox for his valour.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>True; and a goose for his discretion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his<br />
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;<br />
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:<br />
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the
moon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Moonshine</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He should have worn the horns on his head.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is no crescent, and his horns are<br />
invisible within the circumference.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Moonshine</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;<br />
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man<br />
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the<br />
man i' the moon?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you<br />
see, it is already in snuff.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that<br />
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all<br />
reason, we must stay the time.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proceed, Moon.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Moonshine</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the<br />
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this<br />
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all<br />
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Thisbe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Roaring] Oh—<br /></p>
<p><em>Thisbe runs off</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well roared, Lion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well run, Thisbe.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a<br />
good grace.<br /></p>
<p><em>The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well moused, Lion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so the lion vanished.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then came Pyramus.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter Pyramus</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;<br />
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;<br />
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<br />
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.<br />
But stay, O spite!<br />
But mark, poor knight,<br />
What dreadful dole is here!<br />
Eyes, do you see?<br />
How can it be?<br />
O dainty duck! O dear!<br />
Thy mantle good,<br />
What, stain'd with blood!<br />
Approach, ye Furies fell!<br />
O Fates, come, come,<br />
Cut thread and thrum;<br />
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would<br />
go near to make a man look sad.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pyramus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?<br />
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:<br />
Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame<br />
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd<br />
with cheer.<br />
Come, tears, confound;<br />
Out, sword, and wound<br />
The pap of Pyramus;<br />
Ay, that left pap,<br />
Where heart doth hop:<br /></p>
<p><em>Stabs himself</em></p>
<p>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<br />
Now am I dead,<br />
Now am I fled;<br />
My soul is in the sky:<br />
Tongue, lose thy light;<br />
Moon take thy flight:<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Moonshine</em></p>
<p>Now die, die, die, die, die.<br /></p>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and<br />
prove an ass.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes<br />
back and finds her lover?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and<br />
her passion ends the play.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter Thisbe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a<br />
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which<br />
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;<br />
she for a woman, God bless us.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And thus she means, videlicet:—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thisbe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asleep, my love?<br />
What, dead, my dove?<br />
O Pyramus, arise!<br />
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?<br />
Dead, dead? A tomb<br />
Must cover thy sweet eyes.<br />
These My lips,<br />
This cherry nose,<br />
These yellow cowslip cheeks,<br />
Are gone, are gone:<br />
Lovers, make moan:<br />
His eyes were green as leeks.<br />
O Sisters Three,<br />
Come, come to me,<br />
With hands as pale as milk;<br />
Lay them in gore,<br />
Since you have shore<br />
With shears his thread of silk.<br />
Tongue, not a word:<br />
Come, trusty sword;<br />
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:<br /></p>

<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.<br /></p>

<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, and Wall too.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down that<br />
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the<br />
epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two<br />
of our company?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no<br />
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all<br />
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he<br />
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself<br />
in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine<br />
tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably<br />
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your<br />
epilogue alone.<br /></p>
<p><em>A dance</em></p>
<p>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:<br />
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.<br />
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn<br />
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.<br />
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled<br />
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.<br />
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,<br />
In nightly revels and new jollity.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>

<p>Now the hungry lion roars,<br />
And the wolf behowls the moon;<br />
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,<br />
All with weary task fordone.<br />
Now the wasted brands do glow,<br />
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,<br />
Puts the wretch that lies in woe<br />
In remembrance of a shroud.<br />
Now it is the time of night<br />
That the graves all gaping wide,<br />
Every one lets forth his sprite,<br />
In the church-way paths to glide:<br />
And we fairies, that do run<br />
By the triple Hecate's team,<br />
From the presence of the sun,<br />
Following darkness like a dream,<br />
Now are frolic: not a mouse<br />
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:<br />
I am sent with broom before,<br />
To sweep the dust behind the door.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the house give gathering light,<br />
By the dead and drowsy fire:<br />
Every elf and fairy sprite<br />
Hop as light as bird from brier;<br />
And this ditty, after me,<br />
Sing, and dance it trippingly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, rehearse your song by rote<br />
To each word a warbling note:<br />
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,<br />
Will we sing, and bless this place.<br /></p>
<p><em>Song and dance</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, until the break of day,<br />
Through this house each fairy stray.<br />
To the best bride-bed will we,<br />
Which by us shall blessed be;<br />
And the issue there create<br />
Ever shall be fortunate.<br />
So shall all the couples three<br />
Ever true in loving be;<br />
And the blots of Nature's hand<br />
Shall not in their issue stand;<br />
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,<br />
Nor mark prodigious, such as are<br />
Despised in nativity,<br />
Shall upon their children be.<br />
With this field-dew consecrate,<br />
Every fairy take his gait;<br />
And each several chamber bless,<br />
Through this palace, with sweet peace;<br />
And the owner of it blest<br />
Ever shall in safety rest.<br />
Trip away; make no stay;<br />
Meet me all by break of day.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we shadows have offended,<br />
Think but this, and all is mended,<br />
That you have but slumber'd here<br />
While these visions did appear.<br />
And this weak and idle theme,<br />
No more yielding but a dream,<br />
Gentles, do not reprehend:<br />
if you pardon, we will mend:<br />
And, as I am an honest Puck,<br />
If we have unearned luck<br />
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,<br />
We will make amends ere long;<br />
Else the Puck a liar call;<br />
So, good night unto you all.<br />
Give me your hands, if we be friends,<br />
And Robin shall restore amends.</p>
