<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and
Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<br />
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in<br />
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow<br />
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,<br />
Like to a step-dame or a dowager<br />
Long withering out a young man revenue.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;<br />
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<br />
And then the moon, like to a silver bow<br />
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night<br />
Of our solemnities.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, Philostrate,<br />
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;<br />
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;<br />
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<br />
The pale companion is not for our pomp.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit PHILOSTRATE</em></p>
<p>Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,<br />
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;<br />
But I will wed thee in another key,<br />
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br />
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<br />
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<br />
This man hath my consent to marry her.<br />
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,<br />
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;<br />
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<br />
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:<br />
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<br />
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,<br />
And stolen the impression of her fantasy<br />
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,<br />
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers<br />
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:<br />
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,<br />
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,<br />
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,<br />
Be it so she; will not here before your grace<br />
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br />
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,<br />
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:<br />
Which shall be either to this gentleman<br />
Or to her death, according to our law<br />
Immediately provided in that case.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:<br />
To you your father should be as a god;<br />
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one<br />
To whom you are but as a form in wax<br />
By him imprinted and within his power<br />
To leave the figure or disfigure it.<br />
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So is Lysander.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In himself he is;<br />
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,<br />
The other must be held the worthier.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.<br />
I know not by what power I am made bold,<br />
Nor how it may concern my modesty,<br />
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;<br />
But I beseech your grace that I may know<br />
The worst that may befall me in this case,<br />
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either to die the death or to abjure<br />
For ever the society of men.<br />
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;<br />
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br />
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,<br />
You can endure the livery of a nun,<br />
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,<br />
To live a barren sister all your life,<br />
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<br />
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,<br />
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;<br />
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,<br />
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn<br />
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<br />
Ere I will my virgin patent up<br />
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke<br />
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon—<br />
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,<br />
For everlasting bond of fellowship—<br />
Upon that day either prepare to die<br />
For disobedience to your father's will,<br />
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;<br />
Or on Diana's altar to protest<br />
For aye austerity and single life.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield<br />
Thy crazed title to my certain right.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have her father's love, Demetrius;<br />
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,<br />
And what is mine my love shall render him.<br />
And she is mine, and all my right of her<br />
I do estate unto Demetrius.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<br />
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;<br />
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,<br />
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';<br />
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<br />
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:<br />
Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br />
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,<br />
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,<br />
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br />
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br />
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THESEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must confess that I have heard so much,<br />
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<br />
But, being over-full of self-affairs,<br />
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;<br />
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,<br />
I have some private schooling for you both.<br />
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<br />
To fit your fancies to your father's will;<br />
Or else the law of Athens yields you up—<br />
Which by no means we may extenuate—<br />
To death, or to a vow of single life.<br />
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?<br />
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:<br />
I must employ you in some business<br />
Against our nuptial and confer with you<br />
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EGEUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With duty and desire we follow you.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?<br />
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Belike for want of rain, which I could well<br />
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,<br />
Could ever hear by tale or history,<br />
The course of true love never did run smooth;<br />
But, either it was different in blood,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,—<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<br />
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<br />
Making it momentany as a sound,<br />
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;<br />
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,<br />
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<br />
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'<br />
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:<br />
So quick bright things come to confusion.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,<br />
It stands as an edict in destiny:<br />
Then let us teach our trial patience,<br />
Because it is a customary cross,<br />
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<br />
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.<br />
I have a widow aunt, a dowager<br />
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:<br />
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;<br />
And she respects me as her only son.<br />
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;<br />
And to that place the sharp Athenian law<br />
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,<br />
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;<br />
And in the wood, a league without the town,<br />
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,<br />
To do observance to a morn of May,<br />
There will I stay for thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My good Lysander!<br />
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,<br />
By his best arrow with the golden head,<br />
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,<br />
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br />
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,<br />
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,<br />
By all the vows that ever men have broke,<br />
In number more than ever women spoke,<br />
In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br />
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God speed fair Helena! whither away?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.<br />
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!<br />
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air<br />
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,<br />
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br />
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,<br />
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;<br />
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br />
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.<br />
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br />
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.<br />
O, teach me how you look, and with what art<br />
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O that my prayers could such affection move!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I hate, the more he follows me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I love, the more he hateth me.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;<br />
Lysander and myself will fly this place.<br />
Before the time I did Lysander see,<br />
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:<br />
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,<br />
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:<br />
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br />
Her silver visage in the watery glass,<br />
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,<br />
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,<br />
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in the wood, where often you and I<br />
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,<br />
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br />
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;<br />
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,<br />
To seek new friends and stranger companies.<br />
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;<br />
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!<br />
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight<br />
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will, my Hermia.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit HERMIA</em></p>
<p>Helena, adieu:<br />
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How happy some o'er other some can be!<br />
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<br />
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<br />
He will not know what all but he do know:<br />
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,<br />
So I, admiring of his qualities:<br />
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,<br />
Love can transpose to form and dignity:<br />
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<br />
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:<br />
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;<br />
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:<br />
And therefore is Love said to be a child,<br />
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<br />
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br />
So the boy Love is perjured every where:<br />
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,<br />
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;<br />
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br />
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.<br />
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:<br />
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night<br />
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<br />
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:<br />
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br />
To have his sight thither and back again.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
