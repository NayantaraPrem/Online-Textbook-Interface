<h3 class="section_title">SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you sent to Bottom's house&#160;? is he come home
yet?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>STARVELING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is<br />
transported.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes<br />
not forward, doth it?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not possible: you have not a man in all<br />
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft<br />
man in Athens.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea and the best person too; and he is a very<br />
paramour for a sweet voice.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,<br />
a thing of naught.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter SNUG</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SNUG</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and<br />
there is two or three lords and ladies more married:<br />
if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made<br />
men.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLUTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a<br />
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped<br />
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him<br />
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;<br />
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in<br />
Pyramus, or nothing.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter BOTTOM</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are these lads? where are these hearts?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not<br />
what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I<br />
will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUINCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us hear, sweet Bottom.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOTTOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that<br />
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,<br />
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your<br />
pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look<br />
o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our<br />
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have<br />
clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion<br />
pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the<br />
lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions<br />
nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I<br />
do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet<br />
comedy. No more words: away! go, away!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
