<div class="text">
<p>We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of
nature have become modified by selection by considering a few
cases. I will select only three, namely, the instinct which leads
the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making
instinct of certain ants; and the cell-making power of the
hive-bee: these two latter instincts have generally and justly been
ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known
instincts.</p>
