Hybridism</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of
hybrids — Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by
close interbreeding, removed by domestication — Laws governing the
sterility of hybrids — Sterility not a special endowment, but
incidental on other differences, not accumulated by natural
selection — Causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids
— Parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and
of crossing — Dimorphism and trimorphism — Fertility of varieties
when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal — Hybrids
and mongrels compared independently of their fertility —
