<h3 class="section_title">6. Struggle For Life Most Severe Between
Individuals And Varieties Of The Same Species</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no
means invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and
always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe
between them, if they come into competition with each other, than
between the species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent
extension over parts of the United States of one species of swallow
having caused the decrease of another species. The recent increase
of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease
of the song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat
taking the place of another species under the most different
climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere
driven before it its great congener. In Australia the imported
hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native bee.
One species of charlock has been known to supplant another species;
and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should
be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same
place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could
we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another
in the great battle of life.</p>
<p>A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the
foregoing remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic
being is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to
that of all other organic beings, with which it comes into
competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape,
or on which it preys. This is obvious in the structure of the teeth
and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the
parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger's body. But in the
beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and
fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first
confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the advantage of the
plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land
being already thickly clothed with other plants; so that the seeds
may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the
water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for
diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt
for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other
animals.</p>
<p>The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants
seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants.
But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such
seeds, as peas and beans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it
may be suspected that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is
to favour the growth of the seedlings, whilst struggling with other
plants growing vigorously all around.</p>
<p>Look at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not
double or quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well
withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for
elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier
districts. In this case we can clearly see that if we wish in
imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in numbers,
we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or
over the animals which prey on it. On the confines of its
geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to
climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have
reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far,
that they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate.
Not until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic
regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will competition
cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be
competition between some few species, or between the individuals of
the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots.</p>
<p>Hence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new
country, among new competitors, the conditions of its life will
generally be changed in an essential manner, although the climate
may be exactly the same as in its former home. If its average
numbers are to increase in its new home, we should have to modify
it in a different way to what we should have had to do in its
native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a
different set of competitors or enemies.</p>
<p>It is good thus to try in imagination to give any one species an
advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we
know what to do. This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the
mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary,
as it is difficult to acquire. All that we can do is to keep
steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in
a geometrical ratio; that each, at some period of its life, during
some season of the year, during each generation, or at intervals,
has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we
reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full
belief that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is
felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the
healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.</p>
