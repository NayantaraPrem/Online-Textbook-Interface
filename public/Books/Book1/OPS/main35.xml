<h3 class="section_title">9. On The Degree To Which Organisation
Tends To Advance</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and
accumulation of variations, which are beneficial under the organic
and inorganic conditions to which each creature is exposed at all
periods of life. The ultimate result is that each creature tends to
become more and more improved in relation to its conditions. This
improvement inevitably leads to the gradual advancement of the
organisation of the greater number of living beings throughout the
world. But here we enter on a very intricate subject, for
naturalists have not defined to each other's satisfaction what is
meant by an advance in organisation. Among the vertebrata the
degree of intellect and an approach in structure to man clearly
come into play. It might be thought that the amount of change which
the various parts and organs pass through in their development from
embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but
there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which
several parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the
mature animal cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer's
standard seems the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the
amount of differentiation of the parts of the same organic being,
in the adult state, as I should be inclined to add, and their
specialisation for different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would
express it, the completeness of the division of physiological
labour. But we shall see how obscure this subject is if we look,
for instance, to fishes, among which some naturalists rank those as
highest which, like the sharks, approach nearest to amphibians;
while other naturalists rank the common bony or teleostean fishes
as the highest, inasmuch as they are most strictly fish- like, and
differ most from the other vertebrate classes. We see still more
plainly the obscurity of the subject by turning to plants, among
which the standard of intellect is of course quite excluded; and
here some botanists rank those plants as highest which have every
organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and pistils, fully developed in
each flower; whereas other botanists, probably with more truth,
look at the plants which have their several organs much modified
and reduced in number as the highest.</p>
<p>If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of
differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each
being when adult (and this will include the advancement of the
brain for intellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads
towards this standard: for all physiologists admit that the
specialisation of organs, inasmuch as in this state they perform
their functions better, is an advantage to each being; and hence
the accumulation of variations tending towards specialisation is
within the scope of natural selection. On the other hand, we can
see, bearing in mind that all organic beings are striving to
increase at a high ratio and to seize on every unoccupied or less
well occupied place in the economy of nature, that it is quite
possible for natural selection gradually to fit a being to a
situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless:
in such cases there would be retrogression in the scale of
organisation. Whether organisation on the whole has actually
advanced from the remotest geological periods to the present day
will be more conveniently discussed in our chapter on Geological
Succession.</p>
<p>But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to
rise in the scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude
of the lowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each great
class some forms are far more highly developed than others? Why
have not the more highly developed forms every where supplanted and
exterminated the lower? Lamarck, who believed in an innate and
inevitable tendency towards perfection in all organic beings, seems
to have felt this difficulty so strongly that he was led to suppose
that new and simple forms are continually being produced by
spontaneous generation. Science has not as yet proved the truth of
this belief, whatever the future may reveal. On our theory the
continued existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for
natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not
necessarily include progressive development—it only takes advantage
of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature
under its complex relations of life. And it may be asked what
advantage, as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian
animalcule—to an intestinal worm—or even to an earth-worm, to be
highly organised. If it were no advantage, these forms would be
left, by natural selection, unimproved or but little improved, and
might remain for indefinite ages in their present lowly condition.
And geology tells us that some of the lowest forms, as the
infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an enormous period in
nearly their present state. But to suppose that most of the many
now existing low forms have not in the least advanced since the
first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for every naturalist
who has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the
scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and
beautiful organisation.</p>
<p>Nearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the
different grades of organisation within the same great group; for
instance, in the vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and
fish—among mammalia, to the co-existence of man and the
ornithorhynchus—among fishes, to the co- existence of the shark and
the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter fish in the extreme
simplicity of its structure approaches the invertebrate classes.
But mammals and fish hardly come into competition with each other;
the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of certain
members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to their
taking the place of fishes. Physiologists believe that the brain
must be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires
aerial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting
the water lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to
the surface to breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family
would not tend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I
hear from Fritz Muller, has as sole companion and competitor on the
barren sandy shore of South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three
lowest orders of mammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and
rodents, co-exist in South America in the same region with numerous
monkeys, and probably interfere little with each other. Although
organisation, on the whole, may have advanced and be still
advancing throughout the world, yet the scale will always present
many degrees of perfection; for the high advancement of certain
whole classes, or of certain members of each class, does not at all
necessarily lead to the extinction of those groups with which they
do not enter into close competition. In some cases, as we shall
hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have been preserved
to the present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar stations,
where they have been subjected to less severe competition, and
where their scanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable
variations arising.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist
throughout the world, from various causes. In some cases variations
or individual differences of a favourable nature may never have
arisen for natural selection to act on and accumulate. In no case,
probably, has time sufficed for the utmost possible amount of
development. In some few cases there has been what we must call
retrogression or organisation. But the main cause lies in the fact
that under very simple conditions of life a high organisation would
be of no service—possibly would be of actual disservice, as being
of a more delicate nature, and more liable to be put out of order
and injured.</p>
<p>Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as
we may believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been
asked, could the first step in the advancement or differentiation
of parts have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer
that, as soon as simple unicellular organisms came by growth or
division to be compounded of several cells, or became attached to
any supporting surface, his law "that homologous units of any order
become differentiated in proportion as their relations to incident
forces become different" would come into action. But as we have no
facts to guide us, speculation on the subject is almost useless. It
is, however, an error to suppose that there would be no struggle
for existence, and, consequently, no natural selection, until many
forms had been produced: variations in a single species inhabiting
an isolated station might be beneficial, and thus the whole mass of
individuals might be modified, or two distinct forms might arise.
But, as I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no one
ought to feel</p>
<p>surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the origin of
species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance on the
mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present
time, and still more so during past ages.</p>
