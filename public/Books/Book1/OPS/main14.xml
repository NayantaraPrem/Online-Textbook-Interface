<h3 class="section_title">3. Doubtful Species</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The forms which possess in some considerable degree the
character of species, but which are so closely similar to other
forms, or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations,
that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are
in several respects the most important for us. We have every reason
to believe that many of these doubtful and closely allied forms
have permanently retained their characters for a long time; for as
long, as far as we know, as have good and true species.
Practically, when a naturalist can unite by means of intermediate
links any two forms, he treats the one as a variety of the other,
ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described as
the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great
difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise in
deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another,
even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor
will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms
always remove the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form
is ranked as a variety of another, not because the intermediate
links have actually been found, but because analogy leads the
observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may
formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt
and conjecture is opened.</p>
<p>Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a
species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound
judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We
must, however, in many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists,
for few well-marked and well-known varieties can be named which
have not been ranked as species by at least some competent
judges.</p>
<p>That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon
cannot be disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of
France, or of the United States, drawn up by different botanists,
and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one
botanist as good species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr.
H.C. Watson, to whom I lie under deep obligation for assistance of
all kinds, has marked for me 182 British plants, which are
generally considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked
by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted
many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by
some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several
highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most
polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr.
Bentham gives only 112â€”a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Among
animals which unite for each birth, and which are highly
locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species
and by another as a variety, can rarely be found within the same
country, but are common in separated areas. How many of the birds
and insects in North America and Europe, which differ very slightly
from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as
undoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are
often called, geographical races! Mr. Wallace, in several valuable
papers on the various animals, especially on the Lepidoptera,
inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan Archipelago, shows that
they may be classed under four heads, namely, as variable forms, as
local forms, as geographical races or sub-species, and as true
representative species. The first or variable forms vary much
within the limits of the same island. The local forms are
moderately constant and distinct in each separate island; but when
all from the several islands are compared together, the differences
are seen to be so slight and graduated that it is impossible to
define or describe them, though at the same time the extreme forms
are sufficiently distinct. The geographical races or sub-species
are local forms completely fixed and isolated; but as they do not
differ from each other by strongly marked and important characters,
"There is no possible test but individual opinion to determine
which of them shall be considered as species and which as
varieties." Lastly, representative species fill the same place in
the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and
sub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a
greater amount of difference than that between the local forms and
sub-species, they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as
true species. Nevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be
given by which variable forms, local forms, sub species and
representative species can be recognised.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the
birds from the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos
Archipelago, one with another, and with those from the American
mainland, I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the
distinction between species and varieties. On the islets of the
little Madeira group there are many insects which are characterized
as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's admirable work, but which would
certainly be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. Even
Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but
which have been ranked as species by some zoologists. Several
experienced ornithologists consider our British red grouse as only
a strongly marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas the greater
number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great Britain. A
wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many
naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it
has been well asked, will suffice if that between America and
Europe is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or
Madeira, or the Canaries, or between the several islets of these
small archipelagos, be sufficient?</p>
<p>Mr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United
States, has described what he calls Phytophagic varieties and
Phytophagic species. Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one
kind of plant or on one group of plants; some feed indiscriminately
on many kinds, but do not in consequence vary. In several cases,
however, insects found living on different plants, have been
observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their larval or mature state,
or in both states, slight, though constant differences in colour,
size, or in the nature of their secretions. In some instances the
males alone, in other instances, both males and females, have been
observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the differences
are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and all ages
are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good
species. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can
do so for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be
called species and which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which
it may be supposed would freely intercross, as varieties; and those
which appear to have lost this power, as species. As the
differences depend on the insects having long fed on distinct
plants, it cannot be expected that intermediate links connecting
the several forms should now be found. The naturalist thus loses
his best guide in determining whether to rank doubtful forms as
varieties or species. This likewise necessarily occurs with closely
allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or islands.
When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the same
continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and
presents different forms in the different areas, there is always a
good chance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will
link together the extreme states; and these are then degraded to
the rank of varieties.</p>
<p>Some few naturalists maintain that animals never present
varieties; but then these same naturalists rank the slightest
difference as of specific value; and when the same identical form
is met with in two distant countries, or in two geological
formations, they believe that two distinct species are hidden under
the same dress. The term species thus comes to be a mere useless
abstraction, implying and assuming a separate act of creation. It
is certain that many forms, considered by highly competent judges
to be varieties, resemble species so completely in character that
they have been thus ranked by other highly competent judges. But to
discuss whether they ought to be called species or varieties,
before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted,
is vainly to beat the air.</p>
<p>Many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful
species well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines
of argument, from geographical distribution, analogical variation,
hybridism, etc., have been brought to bear in the attempt to
determine their rank; but space does not here permit me to discuss
them. Close investigation, in many cases, will no doubt bring
naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be
confessed that it is in the best known countries that we find the
greatest number of them. I have been struck with the fact that if
any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man,
or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of it
will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties,
moreover, will often be ranked by some authors as species. Look at
the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a German
author makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are
almost universally considered by other botanists to be varieties;
and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical
men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks
are either good and distinct species or mere varieties.</p>
<p>I may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A.
de Candolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more
ample materials for the discrimination of the species, or could
have worked on them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in
detail all the many points of structure which vary in the several
species, and estimates numerically the relative frequency of the
variations. He specifies above a dozen characters which may be
found varying even on the same branch, sometimes according to age
or development, sometimes without any assignable reason. Such
characters are not of course of specific value, but they are, as
Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir, such as
generally enter into specific definitions. De Candolle then goes on
to say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ
by characters never varying on the same tree, and never found
connected by intermediate states. After this discussion, the result
of so much labour, he emphatically remarks: "They are mistaken, who
repeat that the greater part of our species are clearly limited,
and that the doubtful species are in a feeble minority. This seemed
to be true, so long as a genus was imperfectly known, and its
species were founded upon a few specimens, that is to say, were
provisional. Just as we come to know them better, intermediate
forms flow in, and doubts as to specific limits augment." He also
adds that it is the best known species which present the greatest
number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties. Thus Quercus
robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting six, are
clustered round three sub- species, namely Q. pedunculata,
sessiliflora and pubescens. The forms which connect these three
sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks,
if these connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally
extinct the three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation
to each other as do the four or five provisionally admitted species
which closely surround the typical Quercus robur. Finally, De
Candolle admits that out of the 300 species, which will be
enumerated in his Prodromus as belonging to the oak family, at
least two-thirds are provisional species, that is, are not known
strictly to fulfil the definition above given of a true species. It
should be added that De Candolle no longer believes that species
are immutable creations, but concludes that the derivative theory
is the most natural one, "and the most accordant with the known
facts in palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of
anatomical structure and classification."</p>
<p>When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of
organisms quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in
determining what differences to consider as specific and what as
varietal; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation
to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very
generally there is some variation. But if he confine his attention
to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind how
to rank most of the doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to
make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the
pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded to, with the amount of
difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he
has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other
groups and in other countries by which to correct his first
impressions. As he extends the range of his observations he will
meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater
number of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely
extended he will in the end generally be able to make up his own
mind; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much
variation, and the truth of this admission will often be disputed
by other naturalists. When he comes to study allied forms brought
from countries not now continuous, in which case he cannot hope to
find intermediate links, he will be compelled to trust almost
entirely to analogy, and his difficulties will rise to a
climax.</p>
<p>Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn
between species and sub-speciesâ€”that is, the forms which in the
opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite
arrive at, the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and
well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual
differences. These differences blend into each other by an
insensible series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of
an actual passage.</p>
<p>Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest
to the systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being
the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought
worth recording in works on natural history. And I look at
varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as
steps toward more strongly marked and permanent varieties; and at
the latter, as leading to sub-species, and then to species. The
passage from one stage of difference to another may, in many cases,
be the simple result of the nature of the organism and of the
different physical conditions to which it has long been exposed;
but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters, the
passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely
attributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter
to be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse
of parts. A well-marked variety may therefore be called an
incipient species; but whether this belief is justifiable must be
judged by the weight of the various facts and considerations to be
given throughout this work.</p>
<p>It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species
attain the rank of species. They may become extinct, or they may
endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be
the case by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil
land-shells in Madeira, and with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a
variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent
species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the
variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent
species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent
species. But we shall hereafter return to this subject.</p>
<p>From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term
species as one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a
set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does
not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to
less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again,
in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied
arbitrarily, for convenience sake.</p>
