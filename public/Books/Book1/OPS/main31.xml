<h3 class="section_title">5. Circumstances Favourable For The
Production Of New Forms Through Natural Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>This is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of
variability, under which term individual differences are always
included, will evidently be favourable. A large number of
individuals, by giving a better chance within any given period for
the appearance of profitable variations, will compensate for a
lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe,
a highly important element of success. Though nature grants long
periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not
grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving
to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species
does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree
with its competitors it will be exterminated. Unless favourable
variations be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing
can be effected by natural selection. The tendency to reversion may
often check or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not
prevented man from forming by selection numerous domestic races,
why should it prevail against natural selection?</p>
<p>In the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some
definite object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to
intercross, his work will completely fail. But when many men,
without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard
of perfection, and all try to procure and breed from the best
animals, improvement surely but slowly follows from this
unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that there is no
separation of selected individuals. Thus it will be under nature;
for within a confined area, with some place in the natural polity
not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right
direction, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved.
But if the area be large, its several districts will almost
certainly present different conditions of life; and then, if the
same species undergoes modification in different districts, the
newly formed varieties will intercross on the confines of each. But
we shall see in the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties,
inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the long run generally
be supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties. Intercrossing will
chiefly affect those animals which unite for each birth and wander
much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. Hence with
animals of this nature, for instance birds, varieties will
generally be confined to separated countries; and this I find to be
the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only
occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth,
but which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and
improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might
there maintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the
individuals of the new variety would chiefly cross together. On
this principle nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large
body of plants, as the chance of intercrossing is thus
lessened.</p>
<p>Even with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not
propagate rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would
always eliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring
forward a considerable body of facts showing that within the same
area two varieties of the same animal may long remain distinct,
from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly
different seasons, or from the individuals of each variety
preferring to pair together.</p>
<p>Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping
the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true
and uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more
efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth; but, as
already stated, we have reason to believe that occasional
intercrosses take place with all animals and plants. Even if these
take place only at long intervals of time, the young thus produced
will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from
long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a better
chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus in the
long run the influence of crosses, even at rare intervals, will be
great. With respect to organic beings extremely low in the scale,
which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which cannot
possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by
them under the same conditions of life, only through the principle
of inheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy
any individuals departing from the proper type. If the conditions
of life change and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of
character can be given to the modified offspring, solely by natural
selection preserving similar favourable variations.</p>
<p>Isolation also is an important element in the modification of
species through natural selection. In a confined or isolated area,
if not very large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life
will generally be almost uniform; so that natural selection will
tend to modify all the varying individuals of the same species in
the same manner. Intercrossing with the inhabitants of the
surrounding districts, will also be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner
has lately published an interesting essay on this subject, and has
shown that the service rendered by isolation in preventing crosses
between newly-formed varieties is probably greater even than I
supposed. But from reasons already assigned I can by no means agree
with this naturalist, that migration and isolation are necessary
elements for the formation of new species. The importance of
isolation is likewise great in preventing, after any physical
change in the conditions, such as of climate, elevation of the
land, etc., the immigration of better adapted organisms; and thus
new places in the natural economy of the district will be left open
to be filled up by the modification of the old inhabitants. Lastly,
isolation will give time for a new variety to be improved at a slow
rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance. If, however, an
isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by
barriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the
total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this will retard
the production of new species through natural selection, by
decreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.</p>
<p>The mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or
against natural selection. I state this because it has been
erroneously asserted that the element of time has been assumed by
me to play an all-important part in modifying species, as if all
the forms of life were necessarily undergoing change through some
innate law. Lapse of time is only so far important, and its
importance in this respect is great, that it gives a better chance
of beneficial variations arising and of their being selected,
accumulated, and fixed. It likewise tends to increase the direct
action of the physical conditions of life, in relation to the
constitution of each organism.</p>
<p>If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and
look at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island,
although the number of the species inhabiting it is small, as we
shall see in our chapter on Geographical Distribution; yet of these
species a very large proportion are endemic,â€”that is, have been
produced there and nowhere else in the world. Hence an oceanic
island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the
production of new species. But we may thus deceive ourselves, for
to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area
like a continent, has been most favourable for the production of
new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal
times; and this we are incapable of doing.</p>
<p>Although isolation is of great importance in the production of
new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness
of area is still more important, especially for the production of
species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period,
and of spreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only
will there be a better chance of favourable variations, arising
from the large number of individuals of the same species there
supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from
the large number of already existing species; and if some of these
many species become modified and improved, others will have to be
improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated.
Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be
able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus
come into competition with many other forms. Moreover, great areas,
though now continuous, will often, owing to former oscillations of
level, have existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects
of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred.
Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas have been
in some respects highly favourable for the production of new
species, yet that the course of modification will generally have
been more rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that
the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been
victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread
most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new
varieties and species. They will thus play a more important part in
the changing history of the organic world.</p>
<p>In accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some
facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical
Distribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the
smaller continent of Australia now yielding before those of the
larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental
productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on
islands. On a small island, the race for life will have been less
severe, and there will have been less modification and less
extermination. Hence, we can understand how it is that the flora of
Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles to a certain extent
the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh water basins, taken
together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the
land. Consequently, the competition between fresh water productions
will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been
more slowly produced, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And
it is in fresh water basins that we find seven genera of Ganoid
fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water
we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as
the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect
to a certain extent orders at present widely separated in the
natural scale. These anomalous forms may be called living fossils;
they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a
confined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and
therefore less severe, competition.</p>
<p>To sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject
permits, the circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the
production of new species through natural selection. I conclude
that for terrestrial productions a large continental area, which
has undergone many oscillations of level, will have been the most
favourable for the production of many new forms of life, fitted to
endure for a long time and to spread widely. While the area existed
as a continent the inhabitants will have been numerous in
individuals and kinds, and will have been subjected to severe
competition. When converted by subsidence into large separate
islands there will still have existed many individuals of the same
species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range
of each new species will have been checked: after physical changes
of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so that new
places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled up
by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been
allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and
perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted
into a continental area, there will again have been very severe
competition; the most favoured or improved varieties will have been
enabled to spread; there will have been much extinction of the less
improved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the
various inhabitants of the reunited continent will again have been
changed; and again there will have been a fair field for natural
selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus to
produce new species.</p>
<p>That natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I
fully admit. It can act only when there are places in the natural
polity of a district which can be better occupied by the
modification of some of its existing inhabitants. The occurrence of
such places will often depend on physical changes, which generally
take place very slowly, and on the immigration of better adapted
forms being prevented. As some few of the old inhabitants become
modified the mutual relations of others will often be disturbed;
and this will create new places, ready to be filled up by better
adapted forms; but all this will take place very slowly. Although
all the individuals of the same species differ in some slight
degree from each other, it would often be long before differences
of the right nature in various parts of the organisation might
occur. The result would often be greatly retarded by free
intercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are
amply sufficient to neutralise the power of natural selection. I do
not believe so. But I do believe that natural selection will
generally act very slowly, only at long intervals of time, and only
on a few of the inhabitants of the same region. I further believe
that these slow, intermittent results accord well with what geology
tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of the
world have changed.</p>
<p>Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can
do much by artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount
of change, to the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations
between all organic beings, one with another and with their
physical conditions of life, which may have been effected in the
long course of time through nature's power of selection, that is by
the survival of the fittest.</p>
