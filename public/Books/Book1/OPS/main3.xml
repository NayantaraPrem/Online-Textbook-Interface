<h3 class="section_title">The Earth as a Moving Car</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Everyone knows that a person may be sitting in any kind of a
vehicle without noticing its progress, so long as the movement does
not vary in direction or speed; in a car of a fast express train
objects fall in just the same way as in a coach that is standing
still. Only when we look at objects outside the train, or when the
air can enter the car, do we notice indications of the motion. We
may compare the earth with such a moving vehicle, which in its
course around the sun has a remarkable speed, of which the
direction and velocity during a considerable period of time may be
regarded as constant. In place of the air now comes, so it was
reasoned formerly, the ether which fills the spaces of the universe
and is the carrier of light and of electro-magnetic phenomena;
there were good reasons to assume that the earth was entirely
permeable for the ether and could travel through it without setting
it in motion. So here was a case comparable with that of a railroad
coach open on all sides. There certainly should have been a
powerful “ether wind” blowing through the earth and all our
instruments, and it was to have been expected that some signs of it
would be noticed in connection with some experiment or other. Every
attempt along that line, however, has remained fruitless; all the
phenomena examined were evidently independent of the motion of the
earth. That this is the way they do function was brought to the
front by Einstein in his first or “special” theory of relativity.
For him the ether does not function and in the sketch that he draws
of natural phenomena there is no mention of that intermediate
matter.</p>
<p>If the spaces of the universe are filled with an ether, let us
suppose with a substance, in which, aside from eventual vibrations
and other slight movements, there is never any crowding or flowing
of one part alongside of another, then we can imagine fixed points
existing in it; for example, points in a straight line, located one
meter apart, points in a level plain, like the angles or squares on
a chess board extending out into infinity, and finally, points in
space as they are obtained by repeatedly shifting that level spot a
distance of a meter in the direction perpendicular to it. If,
consequently, one of the points is chosen as an “original point” we
can, proceeding from that point, reach any other point through
three steps in the common perpendicular directions in which the
points are arranged. The figures showing how many meters are
comprized in each of the steps may serve to indicate the place
reached and to distinguish it from any other; these are, as is
said, the “co-ordinates” of these places, comparable, for example,
with the numbers on a map giving the longitude and latitude. Let us
imagine that each point has noted upon it the three numbers that
give its position, then we have something comparable with a measure
with numbered subdivisions; only we now have to do, one might say,
with a good many imaginary measures in three common perpendicular
directions. In this “system of co-ordinates” the numbers that fix
the position of one or the other of the bodies may now be read off
at any moment.</p>
<p>This is the means which the astronomers and their mathematical
assistants have always used in dealing with the movement of the
heavenly bodies. At a determined moment the position of each body
is fixed by its three co-ordinates. If these are given, then one
knows also the common distances, as well as the angles formed by
the connecting lines, and the movement of a planet is to be known
as soon as one knows how its co-ordinates are changing from one
moment to the other. Thus the picture that one forms of the
phenomena stands there as if it were sketched on the canvas of the
motionless ether.</p>
