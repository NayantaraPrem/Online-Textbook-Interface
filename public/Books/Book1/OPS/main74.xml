<h3 class="section_title">4. Origin And Causes Of The Sterility Of
First Crosses And Of Hybrids</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others,
that the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been
slowly acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened
degrees of fertility, which, like any other variation,
spontaneously appeared in certain individuals of one variety when
crossed with those of another variety. For it would clearly be
advantageous to two varieties or incipient species if they could be
kept from blending, on the same principle that, when man is
selecting at the same time two varieties, it is necessary that he
should keep them separate. In the first place, it may be remarked
that species inhabiting distinct regions are often sterile when
crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage to such
separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile, and
consequently this could not have been effected through natural
selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was
rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other
species would follow as a necessary contingency. In the second
place, it is almost as much opposed to the theory of natural
selection as to that of special creation, that in reciprocal
crosses the male element of one form should have been rendered
utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same time the male
element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the
first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system
could hardly have been advantageous to either species.</p>
<p>In considering the probability of natural selection having come
into action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest
difficulty will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated
steps, from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It
may be admitted that it would profit an incipient species, if it
were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its
parent form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised
and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their
blood with the new species in process of formation. But he who will
take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree
of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that
high degree which is common with so many species, and which is
universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic
or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex.
After mature reflection, it seems to me that this could not have
been effected through natural selection. Take the case of any two
species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile offspring;
now, what is there which could favour the survival of those
individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher
degree with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one
small step towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind,
if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear, must have
incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude are
mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason
to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have
been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage
having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they
belonged over other communities of the same species; but an
individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered
slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not
thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to
the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their
preservation.</p>
<p>But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail:
for with plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of
crossed species must be due to some principle, quite independent of
natural selection. Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in
genera including numerous species, a series can be formed from
species which when crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species
which never produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the
pollen of certain other species, for the germen swells. It is here
manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which
have already ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme of sterility,
when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained through
selection; and from the laws governing the various grades of
sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, we may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the
same or nearly the same in all cases.</p>
<p>We will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the
differences between species which induce sterility in first crosses
and in hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less
difficulty in effecting a union and in obtaining offspring
apparently depends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes
be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule,
as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the
pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that
when the pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a
distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do
not penetrate the stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may
reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to
be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of Thuret's
experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given of these facts,
any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others.
Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early
period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended
to; but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr.
Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising pheasants and
fowls, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause
of sterility in first crosses. Mr. Salter has recently given the
results of an examination of about 500 eggs produced from various
crosses between three species of Gallus and their hybrids; the
majority of these eggs had been fertilised; and in the majority of
the fertilised eggs, the embryos had either been partially
developed and had then perished, or had become nearly mature, but
the young chickens had been unable to break through the shell. Of
the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died within the
first few days, or at latest weeks, "without any obvious cause,
apparently from mere inability to live;" so that from the 500 eggs
only twelve chickens were reared. With plants, hybridized embryos
probably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that
hybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and
dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has
recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows. It may be
here worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the
embryos within the eggs of silk moths which had not been
fertilised, pass through their early stages of development and then
perish like the embryos produced by a cross between distinct
species. Until becoming acquainted with these facts, I was
unwilling to believe in the frequent early death of hybrid embryos;
for hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived,
as we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however, are
differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and
living in a country where their two parents live, they are
generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid
partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother;
it may therefore, before birth, as long as it is nourished within
its mother's womb, or within the egg or seed produced by the
mother, be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and
consequently be liable to perish at an early period; more
especially as all very young beings are eminently sensitive to
injurious or unnatural conditions of life. But after all, the cause
more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act of
impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed,
rather than in the conditions to which it is subsequently
exposed.</p>
<p>In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual
elements are imperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different.
I have more than once alluded to a large body of facts showing
that, when animals and plants are removed from their natural
conditions, they are extremely liable to have their reproductive
systems seriously affected. This, in fact, is the great bar to the
domestication of animals. Between the sterility thus superinduced
and that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity. In both
cases the sterility is independent of general health, and is often
accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. In both cases
the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male element
is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more
than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with
systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are
rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole
groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other
hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of
conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a
group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell till
he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under
confinement, or any exotic plant seed freely under culture; nor can
he tell till he tries, whether any two species of a genus will
produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic beings
are placed during several generations under conditions not natural
to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which seems to be
partly due to their reproductive systems having been specially
affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. So
it is with hybrids, for their offspring in successive generations
are eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has
observed.</p>
<p>Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and
unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the
unnatural crossing of two species, the reproductive system,
independently of the general state of health, is affected in a very
similar manner. In the one case, the conditions of life have been
disturbed, though often in so slight a degree as to be
inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of hybrids, the
external conditions have remained the same, but the organisation
has been disturbed by two distinct structures and constitutions,
including of course the reproductive systems, having been blended
into one. For it is scarcely possible that two organisations should
be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the
development, or periodical action, or mutual relations of the
different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of
life. When hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to
their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded
organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their
sterility, though in some degree variable, does not diminish; it is
even apt to increase, this being generally the result, as before
explained, of too close interbreeding. The above view of the
sterility of hybrids being caused by two constitutions being
compounded into one has been strongly maintained by Max
Wichura.</p>
<p>It must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the
above or any other view, several facts with respect to the
sterility of hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of
hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses; or the increased
sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally
resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend that the
foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is
offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is
rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show is, that in two
cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result—in
the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in
the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two
organisations being compounded into one.</p>
<p>A similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very
different class of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief,
founded on a considerable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere
given, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial
to all living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners
in their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or
climate to another, and back again. During the convalescence of
animals, great benefit is derived from almost any change in their
habits of life. Again, both with plants and animals, there is the
clearest evidence that a cross between individuals of the same
species, which differ to a certain extent, gives vigour and
fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding continued
during several generations between the nearest relations, if these
be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to
decreased size, weakness, or sterility.</p>
<p>Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the
conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other
hand, that slight crosses, that is, crosses between the males and
females of the same species, which have been subjected to slightly
different conditions, or which have slightly varied, give vigour
and fertility to the offspring. But, as we have seen, organic
beings long habituated to certain uniform conditions under a state
of nature, when subjected, as under confinement, to a considerable
change in their conditions, very frequently are rendered more or
less sterile; and we know that a cross between two forms that have
become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are
almost always in some degree sterile. I am fully persuaded that
this double parallelism is by no means an accident or an illusion.
He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a multitude of
other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under only
partial confinement in their native country, will be able to
explain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He
will at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races
of some of our domesticated animals, which have often been
subjected to new and not uniform conditions, are quite fertile
together, although they are descended from distinct species, which
would probably have been sterile if aboriginally crossed. The above
two parallel series of facts seem to be connected together by some
common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the
principle of life; this principle, according to Mr. Herbert
Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the incessant
action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout nature,
are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this tendency
is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in
power.</p>
