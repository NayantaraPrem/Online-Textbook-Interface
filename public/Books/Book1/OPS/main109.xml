<h3 class="section_title">3. On The Nature Of The Affinities
Connecting Organic Beings</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to
the larger genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the
groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they
are almost sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more
places in the economy of nature. The larger and more dominant
groups within each class thus tend to go on increasing in size, and
they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus,
we can account for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct,
are included under a few great orders and under still fewer
classes. As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and
how widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact is
striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an insect
belonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I
learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three families of
small size.</p>
<p>In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on
the principle of each group having generally diverged much in
character during the long-continued process of modification, how it
is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in
some degree intermediate between existing groups. As some few of
the old and intermediate forms having transmitted to the present
day descendants but little modified, these constitute our so-called
osculant or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the
greater must be the number of connecting forms which have been
exterminated and utterly lost. And we have evidence of aberrant
groups having suffered severely from extinction, for they are
almost always represented by extremely few species; and such
species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other,
which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and
Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had
each been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at present
by a single one, or by two or three. We can, I think, account for
this fact only by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have
been conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members
still preserved under unusually favourable conditions.</p>
<p>Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one
group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group,
this affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus,
according to Mr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most
nearly related to Marsupials; but in the points in which it
approaches this order, its relations are general, that is, not to
any one Marsupial species more than to another. As these points of
affinity are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they must
be due in accordance with our view to inheritance from a common
progenitor. Therefore, we must suppose either that all Rodents,
including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient Marsupial,
which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in
character with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both
Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and
that both groups have since undergone much modification in
divergent directions. On either view we must suppose that the
bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its
ancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will
not be specially related to any one existing Marsupial, but
indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from having partially
retained the character of their common progenitor, or of some early
member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr.
Waterhouse has remarked, the Phascolomys resembles most nearly, not
any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case,
however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only
analogical, owing to the Phascolomys having become adapted to
habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made
nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities
of distinct families of plants.</p>
<p>On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in
character of the species descended from a common progenitor,
together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in
common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating
affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher
group are connected together. For the common progenitor of a whole
family, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and
subgroups, will have transmitted some of its characters, modified
in various ways and degrees, to all the species; and they will
consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of
affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often
referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is
difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous
kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a
genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do so without this aid,
we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists
have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the
various affinities which they perceive between the many living and
extinct members of the same great natural class.</p>
<p>Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an
important part in defining and widening the intervals between the
several groups in each class. We may thus account for the
distinctness of whole classes from each other—for instance, of
birds from all other vertebrate animals—by the belief that many
ancient forms of life have been utterly lost, through which the
early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early
progenitors of the other and at that time less differentiated
vertebrate classes. There has been much less extinction of the
forms of life which once connected fishes with Batrachians. There
has been still less within some whole classes, for instance the
Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still
linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of
affinities. Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no
means made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this
earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite
impossible to give definitions by which each group could be
distinguished, still a natural classification, or at least a
natural arrangement, would be possible. We shall see this by
turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may represent eleven
Silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups of
modified descendants, with every link in each branch and sub-branch
still alive; and the links not greater than those between existing
varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give
definitions by which the several members of the several groups
could be distinguished from their more immediate parents and
descendants. Yet the arrangement in the diagram would still hold
good and would be natural; for, on the principle of inheritance,
all the forms descended, for instance from A, would have something
in common. In a tree we can distinguish this or that branch, though
at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. We could not,
as I have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out
types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each group,
whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value
of the differences between them. This is what we should be driven
to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any
one class which have lived throughout all time and space. Assuredly
we shall never succeed in making so perfect a collection:
nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending toward this end;
and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the
high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate
and define the groups to which such types belong.</p>
<p>Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from
the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to
extinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any
one parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in
the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination
in group under group. We use the element of descent in classing the
individuals of both sexes and of all ages under one species,
although they may have but few characters in common; we use descent
in classing acknowledged varieties, however different they may be
from their parents; and I believe that this element of descent is
the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under
the term of the Natural System. On this idea of the natural system
being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its
arrangement, with the grades of difference expressed by the terms
genera, families, orders, etc., we can understand the rules which
we are compelled to follow in our classification. We can understand
why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we use
rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological
importance; why, in finding the relations between one group and
another, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and
yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group.
We can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can
be grouped together within a few great classes; and how the several
members of each class are connected together by the most complex
and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never, probably,
disentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between the
members of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in
view, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope
to make sure but slow progress.</p>
<p>Professor Haeckel in his "Generelle Morphologie" and in another
works, has recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to
bear on what he calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all
organic beings. In drawing up the several series he trusts chiefly
to embryological characters, but receives aid from homologous and
rudimentary organs, as well as from the successive periods at which
the various forms of life are believed to have first appeared in
our geological formations. He has thus boldly made a great
beginning, and shows us how classification will in the future be
treated.</p>
