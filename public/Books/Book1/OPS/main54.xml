<h3 class="section_title">4. Organs Of Extreme Perfection And
Complication</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for
adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different
amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first
said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the
common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old
saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot
be trusted in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations
from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be
shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is
certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the
variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if
such variations should be useful to any animal under changing
conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect
and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though
insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as
subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to
light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but
I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in which nerves
cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not
seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode
should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with
this special sensibility.</p>
<p>In searching for the gradations through which an organ in any
species has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its
lineal progenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are
forced to look to other species and genera of the same group, that
is to the collateral descendants from the same parent-form, in
order to see what gradations are possible, and for the chance of
some gradations having been transmitted in an unaltered or little
altered condition. But the state of the same organ in distinct
classes may incidentally throw light on the steps by which it has
been perfected.</p>
<p>The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an
optic nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent
skin, but without any lens or other refractive body. We may,
however, according to M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and
find aggregates of pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of
vision, without any nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue.
Eyes of the above simple nature are not capable of distinct vision,
and serve only to distinguish light from darkness. In certain
star-fishes, small depressions in the layer of pigment which
surrounds the nerve are filled, as described by the author just
quoted, with transparent gelatinous matter, projecting with a
convex surface, like the cornea in the higher animals. He suggests
that this serves not to form an image, but only to concentrate the
luminous rays and render their perception more easy. In this
concentration of the rays we gain the first and by far the most
important step towards the formation of a true, picture-forming
eye; for we have only to place the naked extremity of the optic
nerve, which in some of the lower animals lies deeply buried in the
body, and in some near the surface, at the right distance from the
concentrating apparatus, and an image will be formed on it.</p>
<p>In the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic
nerve simply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a
sort of pupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance.
With insects it is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea
of their great compound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones
include curiously modified nervous filaments. But these organs in
the Articulata are so much diversified that Muller formerly made
three main classes with seven subdivisions, besides a fourth main
class of aggregated simple eyes.</p>
<p>When we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly,
with respect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of
structure in the eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in
mind how small the number of all living forms must be in comparison
with those which have become extinct, the difficulty ceases to be
very great in believing that natural selection may have converted
the simple apparatus of an optic nerve, coated with pigment and
invested by transparent membrane, into an optical instrument as
perfect as is possessed by any member of the Articulata class.</p>
<p>He who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step
further, if he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of
facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of
modification through natural selection; he ought to admit that a
structure even as perfect as an eagle's eye might thus be formed,
although in this case he does not know the transitional states. It
has been objected that in order to modify the eye and still
preserve it as a perfect instrument, many changes would have to be
effected simultaneously, which, it is assumed, could not be done
through natural selection; but as I have attempted to show in my
work on the variation of domestic animals, it is not necessary to
suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous, if they were
extremely slight and gradual. Different kinds of modification
would, also, serve for the same general purpose: as Mr. Wallace has
remarked, "If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it may be
amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration of
density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not
converge to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature
will be an improvement. So the contraction of the iris and the
muscular movements of the eye are neither of them essential to
vision, but only improvements which might have been added and
perfected at any stage of the construction of the instrument."
Within the highest division of the animal kingdom, namely, the
Vertebrata, we can start from an eye so simple, that it consists,
as in the lancelet, of a little sack of transparent skin, furnished
with a nerve and lined with pigment, but destitute of any other
apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has remarked, "The range
of gradation of dioptric structures is very great." It is a
significant fact that even in man, according to the high authority
of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the embryo
by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold of
the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic
subcutaneous tissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion
regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not
absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason
should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far
to keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the
principle of natural selection to so startling a length.</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a
telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the
long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we
naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat
analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have
we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual
powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical
instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of
transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve
sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this
layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to
separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed
at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of
each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that
there is a power, represented by natural selection or the survival
of the fittest, always intently watching each slight alteration in
the transparent layers; and carefully preserving each which, under
varied circumstances, in any way or degree, tends to produce a
distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument
to be multiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a
better is produced, and then the old ones to be all destroyed. In
living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration,
generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural
selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let
this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on
millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that
a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one
of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?</p>
