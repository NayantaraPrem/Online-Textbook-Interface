<h3 class="section_title">4. On The Affinities Of Extinct Species
To Each Other, And To Living Forms</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living
species. All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at
once explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any
form is, the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms.
But, as Buckland long ago remarked, extinct species can all be
classed either in still existing groups, or between them. That the
extinct forms of life help to fill up the intervals between
existing genera, families, and orders, is certainly true; but as
this statement has often been ignored or even denied, it may be
well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give some
instances. If we confine our attention either to the living or to
the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less
perfect than if we combine both into one general system. In the
writings of Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression
of generalised forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the
writings of Agassiz, of prophetic or synthetic types; and these
terms imply that such forms are, in fact, intermediate or
connecting links. Another distinguished palaeontologist, M. Gaudry,
has shown in the most striking manner that many of the fossil
mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break down the
intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and
Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so
many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter
the whole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the
same sub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by
gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig and the
camel. The Ungulata or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the
even-toed or odd-toed divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South
America connects to a certain extent these two grand divisions. No
one will deny that the Hipparion is intermediate between the
existing horse and certain other ungulate forms. What a wonderful
connecting link in the chain of mammals is the Typotherium from
South America, as the name given to it by Professor Gervais
expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order. The
Sirenia form a very distinct group of the mammals, and one of the
most remarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is
the entire absence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being
left; but the extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor
Flower, an ossified thigh-bone "articulated to a well-defined
acetabulum in the pelvis," and it thus makes some approach to
ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the Sirenia are in other
respects allied. The cetaceans or whales are widely different from
all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and Squalodon, which
have been placed by some naturalists in an order by themselves, are
considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly cetaceans, "and to
constitute connecting links with the aquatic carnivora."</p>
<p>Even the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown
by the naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the
most unexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct
Archeopteryx, and on the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of
the Dinosaurians—that group which includes the most gigantic of all
terrestrial reptiles. Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande
asserts, a higher authority could not be named, that he is every
day taught that, although palaeozoic animals can certainly be
classed under existing groups, yet that at this ancient period the
groups were not so distinctly separated from each other as they now
are.</p>
<p>Some writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of
species, being considered as intermediate between any two living
species, or groups of species. If by this term it is meant that an
extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between
two living forms or groups, the objection is probably valid. But in
a natural classification many fossil species certainly stand
between living species, and some extinct genera between living
genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. The
most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups,
such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing them to be
distinguished at the present day by a score of characters, the
ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of
characters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer
approach to each other than they now do.</p>
<p>It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so
much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups
now widely separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be
restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the
course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the
truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a living
animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities
directed towards very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older
Reptiles and Batrachians, the older Fish, the older Cephalopods,
and the eocene Mammals, with the recent members of the same
classes, we must admit that there is truth in the remark.</p>
<p>Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord
with the theory of descent with modification. As the subject is
somewhat complex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram
in the fourth chapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters in
italics represent genera, and the dotted lines diverging from them
the species in each genus. The diagram is much too simple, too few
genera and too few species being given, but this is unimportant for
us. The horizontal lines may represent successive geological
formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be
considered as extinct. The three existing genera, a14, q14, p14,
will form a small family; b14 and f14, a closely allied family or
subfamily; and o14, i14, m14, a third family. These three families,
together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of
descent diverging from the parent form (A) will form an order; for
all will have inherited something in common from their ancient
progenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to
divergence of character, which was formerly illustrated by this
diagram, the more recent any form is the more it will generally
differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence, we can understand the
rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms.
We must not, however, assume that divergence of character is a
necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a
species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in
the economy of nature. Therefore it is quite possible, as we have
seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on
being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered
conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the
same general characteristics. This is represented in the diagram by
the letter F14.</p>
<p>All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A),
make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the
continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has
become divided into several sub-families and families, some of
which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some
to have endured to the present day.</p>
<p>By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct
forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were
discovered at several points low down in the series, the three
existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less
distinct from each other. If, for instance, the genera a1, a5, a10,
f8, m3, m6, m9, were disinterred, these three families would be so
closely linked together that they probably would have to be united
into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred
with ruminants and certain pachyderms. Yet he who objected to
consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which thus link
together the living genera of three families, would be partly
justified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a
long and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If
many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle
horizontal lines or geological formations—for instance, above No.
VI.—but none from beneath this line, then only two of the families
(those on the left hand a14, etc., and b14, etc.) would have to be
united into one; and there would remain two families which would be
less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery
of the fossils. So again, if the three families formed of eight
genera (a14 to m14), on the uppermost line, be supposed to differ
from each other by half-a-dozen important characters, then the
families which existed at a period marked VI would certainly have
differed from each other by a less number of characters; for they
would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less degree
from their common progenitor. Thus it comes that ancient and
extinct genera are often in a greater or less degree intermediate
in character between their modified descendants, or between their
collateral relations.</p>
<p>Under nature the process will be far more complicated than is
represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more
numerous; they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of
time, and will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess
only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very
broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in rare cases,
to fill up the wide intervals in the natural system, and thus to
unite distinct families or orders. All that we have a right to
expect is, that those groups which have, within known geological
periods, undergone much modification, should in the older
formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the
older members should differ less from each other in some of their
characters than do the existing members of the same groups; and
this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists is
frequently the case.</p>
<p>Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts
with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life
to each other and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory
manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.</p>
<p>On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one
great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general
character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it.
Thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in
the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the
fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more
modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be
nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above
and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of
some preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of
new forms from other regions, and for a large amount of
modification during the long and blank intervals between the
successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of
each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character,
between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one
instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian
system, when this system was first discovered, were at once
recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in character between
those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian
systems. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as
unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive
formations.</p>
<p>It is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the
fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character
between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera
offer exceptions to the rule. For instance, the species of
mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two
series—in the first place according to their mutual affinities, and
in the second place according to their periods of existence—do not
accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the
oldest or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in
character, intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in
this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance
and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far from
the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively
produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A
very ancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a
form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of
terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare
small things with great; if the principal living and extinct races
of the domestic pigeon were arranged in serial affinity, this
arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of
their production, and even less with the order of their
disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon still lives; and many
varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become
extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important character
of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers,
which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains
from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in
character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that
fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely
related to each other, than are the fossils from two remote
formations. Pictet gives as a well-known instance, the general
resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the
Chalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage.
This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have shaken
Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of species. He
who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over
the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of
distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical
conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same.
Let it be remembered that the forms of life, at least those
inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously throughout
the world, and therefore under the most different climates and
conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during
the pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial epoch, and
note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea
have been affected.</p>
<p>On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains
from closely consecutive formations, being closely related, though
ranked as distinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each
formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals
have intervened between successive formations, we ought not to
expect to find, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any
one or in any two formations, all the intermediate varieties
between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of
these periods: but we ought to find after intervals, very long as
measured by years, but only moderately long as measured
geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by
some authors, representative species; and these assuredly we do
find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely
sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the right to
expect.</p>
