<h3 class="section_title">5. On The Sudden Appearance Of Whole
Groups Of Allied Species</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly
appear in certain formations, has been urged by several
palaeontologistsâ€”for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as
a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If
numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have
really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the
theory of evolution through natural selection. For the development
by this means of a group of forms, all of which are descended from
some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and
the progenitors must have lived long before their modified
descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection of the
geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or
families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did
not exist before that stage. In all cases positive palaeontological
evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless,
as experience has so often shown. We continually forget how large
the world is, compared with the area over which our geological
formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups of
species may elsewhere have long existed, and have slowly
multiplied, before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe
and the United States. We do not make due allowance for the
enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our
consecutive formations, longer perhaps in many cases than the time
required for the accumulation of each formation. These intervals
will have given time for the multiplication of species from some
one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups or
species will appear as if suddenly created.</p>
<p>I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might
require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new
and peculiar line of life, for instance, to fly through the air;
and consequently that the transitional forms would often long
remain confined to some one region; but that, when this adaptation
had once been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great
advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be
necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would spread
rapidly and widely throughout the world. Professor Pictet, in his
excellent Review of this work, in commenting on early transitional
forms, and taking birds as an illustration, cannot see how the
successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a supposed
prototype could possibly have been of any advantage. But look at
the penguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their
front limbs in this precise intermediate state of "neither true
arms nor true wings?" Yet these birds hold their place victoriously
in the battle for life; for they exist in infinite numbers and of
many kinds. I do not suppose that we here see the real transitional
grades through which the wings of birds have passed; but what
special difficulty is there in believing that it might profit the
modified descendants of the penguin, first to become enabled to
flap along the surface of the sea like the logger-headed duck, and
ultimately to rise from its surface and glide through the air?</p>
<p>I will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing
remarks, and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that
whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. Even in so
short an interval as that between the first and second editions of
Pictet's great work on Palaeontology, published in 1844-46 and in
1853-57, the conclusions on the first appearance and disappearance
of several groups of animals have been considerably modified; and a
third edition would require still further changes. I may recall the
well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many
years ago, mammals were always spoken of as having abruptly come in
at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the
richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle
of the secondary series; and true mammals have been discovered in
the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great
series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary
stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India,
South America and in Europe, as far back as the miocene stage. Had
it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps
in the new red sandstone of the United States, who would have
ventured to suppose that no less than at least thirty different
bird-like animals, some of gigantic size, existed during that
period? Not a fragment of bone has been discovered in these beds.
Not long ago, palaeontologists maintained that the whole class of
birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but
now we know, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird
certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and
still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a
long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint,
and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been
discovered in the oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent
discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know
of the former inhabitants of the world.</p>
<p>I may give another instance, which, from having passed under my
own eyes has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile
Cirripedes, I stated that, from the large number of existing and
extinct tertiary species; from the extraordinary abundance of the
individuals of many species all over the world, from the Arctic
regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of depths, from
the upper tidal limits to fifty fathoms; from the perfect manner in
which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the
ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from
all these circumstances, I inferred that, had sessile cirripedes
existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly have
been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had then been
discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group
had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary
series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then thought,
one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of
species. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful
palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect
specimen of an unmistakable sessile cirripede, which he had himself
extracted from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as
striking as possible, this cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very
common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one species has
as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Still more
recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct subfamily of sessile
cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in the upper chalk;
so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence of this
group of animals during the secondary period.</p>
<p>The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the
apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that
of the teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the
Chalk period. This group includes the large majority of existing
species. But certain Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly
admitted to be teleostean; and even some palaeozoic forms have thus
been classed by one high authority. If the teleosteans had really
appeared suddenly in the northern hemisphere at the commencement of
the chalk formation, the fact would have been highly remarkable;
but it would not have formed an insuperable difficulty, unless it
could likewise have been shown that at the same period the species
were suddenly and simultaneously developed in other quarters of the
world. It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any
fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and by running
through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that very few
species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few
families of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes
might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after
having been largely developed in some one sea, have spread widely.
Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have
always been so freely open from south to north as they are at
present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were converted
into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form a
large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of
marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain
confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler
climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or
Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.</p>
<p>From these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of
other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United
States, and from the revolution in our palaeontological knowledge
effected by the discoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me
to be about as rash to dogmatize on the succession of organic forms
throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for
five minutes on a barren point in Australia, and then to discuss
the number and range of its productions.</p>
