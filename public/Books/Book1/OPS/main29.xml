<h3 class="section_title">3. Illustrations Of The Action Of Natural
Selection, Or The Survival Of The Fittest</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection
acts, I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary
illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on
various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some
by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for
instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers,
or that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of
the year when the wolf was hardest pressed for food. Under such
circumstances the swiftest and slimmest wolves have the best chance
of surviving, and so be preserved or selected, provided always that
they retained strength to master their prey at this or some other
period of the year, when they were compelled to prey on other
animals. I can see no more reason to doubt that this would be the
result, than that man should be able to improve the fleetness of
his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that kind
of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying to keep
the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. I may add
that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf
inhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a
light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more
bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the
shepherd's flocks.</p>
<p>Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the
animals on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an
innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be
thought very improbable; for we often observe great differences in
the natural tendencies of our domestic animals; one cat, for
instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to
Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits,
and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching
woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is
known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or
of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best
chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its young
would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the
repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which
would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or,
again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those
frequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt
different prey; and from the continued preservation of the
individuals best fitted for the two sites, two varieties might
slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and blend where they
met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to
return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two
varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the
United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues
deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more
frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.</p>
<p>It should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of
the slimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly
marked variation having been preserved. In former editions of this
work I sometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently
occurred. I saw the great importance of individual differences, and
this led me fully to discuss the results of unconscious selection
by man, which depends on the preservation of all the more or less
valuable individuals, and on the destruction of the worst. I saw,
also, that the preservation in a state of nature of any occasional
deviation of structure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare
event; and that, if at first preserved, it would generally be lost
by subsequent intercrossing with ordinary individuals.
Nevertheless, until reading an able and valuable article in the
"North British Review" (1867), I did not appreciate how rarely
single variations, whether slight or strongly marked, could be
perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of animals,
producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of which,
from various causes of destruction, only two on an average survive
to pro-create their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate for
most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the
lower organisms. He then shows that if a single individual were
born, which varied in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance
of life as that of the other individuals, yet the chances would be
strongly against its survival. Supposing it to survive and to
breed, and that half its young inherited the favourable variation;
still, as the Reviewer goes onto show, the young would have only a
slightly better chance of surviving and breeding; and this chance
would go on decreasing in the succeeding generations. The justice
of these remarks cannot, I think, be disputed. If, for instance, a
bird of some kind could procure its food more easily by having its
beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly curved,
and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be a
very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to
the exclusion of the common form; but there can hardly be a doubt,
judging by what we see taking place under domestication, that this
result would follow from the preservation during many generations
of a large number of individuals with more or less strongly curved
beaks, and from the destruction of a still larger number with the
straightest beaks.</p>
<p>It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather
strongly marked variations, which no one would rank as mere
individual differences, frequently recur owing to a similar
organisation being similarly acted onâ€” of which fact numerous
instances could be given with our domestic productions. In such
cases, if the varying individual did not actually transmit to its
offspring its newly-acquired character, it would undoubtedly
transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions remained the
same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner. There
can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same
manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the
same species have been similarly modified without the aid of any
form of selection. Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the
individuals may have been thus affected, of which fact several
instances could be given. Thus Graba estimates that about one-fifth
of the guillemots in the Faroe Islands consist of a variety so well
marked, that it was formerly ranked as a distinct species under the
name of Uria lacrymans. In cases of this kind, if the variation
were of a beneficial nature, the original form would soon be
supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of the
fittest.</p>
<p>To the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all
kinds, I shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most
animals and plants keep to their proper homes, and do not
needlessly wander about; we see this even with migratory birds,
which almost always return to the same spot. Consequently each
newly-formed variety would generally be at first local, as seems to
be the common rule with varieties in a state of nature; so that
similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a small body
together, and would often breed together. If the new variety were
successful in its battle for life, it would slowly spread from a
central district, competing with and conquering the unchanged
individuals on the margins of an ever-increasing circle.</p>
<p>It may be worth while to give another and more complex
illustration of the action of natural selection. Certain plants
excrete sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating
something injurious from the sap: this is effected, for instance,
by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosae, and at
the backs of the leaves of the common laurel. This juice, though
small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but their visits
do not in any way benefit the plant. Now, let us suppose that the
juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of a
certain number of plants of any species. Insects in seeking the
nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would often transport it
from one flower to another. The flowers of two distinct individuals
of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of
crossing, as can be fully proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings,
which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and
surviving. The plants which produced flowers with the largest
glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar, would oftenest be
visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed; and so in the
long-run would gain the upper hand and form a local variety. The
flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in
relation to the size and habits of the particular insect which
visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of the
pollen, would likewise be favoured. We might have taken the case of
insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead
of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole purpose of
fertilisation, its destruction appears to be a simple loss to the
plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally
and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to
flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the
pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant
to be thus robbed; and the individuals which produced more and more
pollen, and had larger anthers, would be selected.</p>
<p>When our plant, by the above process long continued, had been
rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally
on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and
that they do this effectually I could easily show by many striking
facts. I will give only one, as likewise illustrating one step in
the separation of the sexes of plants. Some holly-trees bear only
male flowers, which have four stamens producing a rather small
quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees
bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four
stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can
be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a
male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from
different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without
exception, there were a few pollen-grains, and on some a profusion.
As the wind had set for several days from the female to the male
tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. The weather had
been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees,
nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been
effectually fertilised by the bees, which had flown from tree to
tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary case; as
soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects
that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another
process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what
has been called the "physiological division of labour;" hence we
may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce
stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils
alone in another flower or on another plant. In plants under
culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male
organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less
impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a
degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried regularly
from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the
sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the
division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more
increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last
a complete separation of the sexes might be effected. It would take
up too much space to show the various steps, through dimorphism and
other means, by which the separation of the sexes in plants of
various kinds is apparently now in progress; but I may add that
some of the species of holly in North America are, according to Asa
Gray, in an exactly intermediate condition, or, as he expresses it,
are more or less dioeciously polygamous.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose
the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by
continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects
depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many
facts showing how anxious bees are to save time: for instance,
their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of
certain flowers, which with a very little more trouble they can
enter by the mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, it may be believed
that under certain circumstances individual differences in the
curvature or length of the proboscis, etc., too slight to be
appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that
certain individuals would be able to obtain their food more quickly
than others; and thus the communities to which they belonged would
flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same
peculiarities. The tubes of the corolla of the common red or
incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a
hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can
easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of
the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so
that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant
supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. That this nectar is much
liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have repeatedly seen, but
only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the flowers through
holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble bees. The difference
in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover, which
determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling; for I
have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers
of the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited
by many hive-bees. I do not know whether this statement is
accurate; nor whether another published statement can be trusted,
namely, that the Ligurian bee, which is generally considered a mere
variety of the common hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it,
is able to reach and suck the nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a
country where this kind of clover abounded, it might be a great
advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently
constructed proboscis. On the other hand, as the fertility of this
clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the flowers, if
humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great
advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided
corolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its
flowers. Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly
become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and
adapted to each other in the most perfect manner, by the continued
preservation of all the individuals which presented slight
deviations of structure mutually favourable to each other.</p>
<p>I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection,
exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same
objections which were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble
views on "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of
geology;" but we now seldom hear the agencies which we see still at
work, spoken of as trifling and insignificant, when used in
explaining the excavation of the deepest valleys or the formation
of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection acts only by the
preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications,
each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has
almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a
single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish the belief
of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great
and sudden modification in their structure.</p>
