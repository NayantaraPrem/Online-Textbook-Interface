<div class="text">
<p>If under changing conditions of life organic beings present
individual differences in almost every part of their structure, and
this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical
rate of increase, a severe struggle for life at some age, season or
year, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the
infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each
other and to their conditions of life, causing an infinite
diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be
advantageous to them, it would be a most extraordinary fact if no
variations had ever occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in
the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful to man.
But if variations useful to any organic being ever do occur,
assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance
of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong
principle of inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring
similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, or the
survival of the fittest, I have called natural selection. It leads
to the improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and
inorganic conditions of life; and consequently, in most cases, to
what must be regarded as an advance in organisation. Nevertheless,
low and simple forms will long endure if well fitted for their
simple conditions of life.</p>
<p>Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited
at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily
as the adult. Among many animals sexual selection will have given
its aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and
best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual
selection will also give characters useful to the males alone in
their struggles or rivalry with other males; and these characters
will be transmitted to one sex or to both sexes, according to the
form of inheritance which prevails.</p>
<p>Whether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the
various forms of life to their several conditions and stations,
must be judged by the general tenour and balance of evidence given
in the following chapters. But we have already seen how it entails
extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's
history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection, also, leads
to divergence of character; for the more organic beings diverge in
structure, habits and constitution, by so much the more can a large
number be supported on the area, of which we see proof by looking
to the inhabitants of any small spot, and to the productions
naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during the modification of
the descendants of any one species, and during the incessant
struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more
diversified the descendants become, the better will be their chance
of success in the battle for life. Thus the small differences
distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend to
increase, till they equal the greater differences between species
of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.</p>
<p>We have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and
widely ranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each
class, which vary most; and these tend to transmit to their
modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant
in their own countries. Natural selection, as has just been
remarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction
of the less improved and intermediate forms of life. On these
principles, the nature of the affinities, and the generally well
defined distinctions between the innumerable organic beings in each
class throughout the world, may be explained. It is a truly
wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from
familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and
space should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to
groups, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties
of the same species most closely related, species of the same genus
less closely and unequally related, forming sections and
sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related,
and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families,
families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. The several subordinate
groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file, but seem
clustered round points, and these round other points, and so on in
almost endless cycles. If species had been independently created,
no explanation would have been possible of this kind of
classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the
complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and
divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the
diagram.</p>
<p>The affinities of all the beings of the same class have
sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile
largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent
existing species; and those produced during former years may
represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of
growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides,
and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the
same manner as species and groups of species have at all times
overmastered other species in the great battle for life. The limbs
divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser
branches, were themselves once, when the tree was young, budding
twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by
ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all
extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the
many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two
or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the
other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past
geological periods, very few have left living and modified
descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and
branch has decayed and dropped off; and these fallen branches of
various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and
genera which have now no living representatives, and which are
known to us only in a fossil state. As we here and there see a
thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree,
and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on
its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the
Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects
by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has
apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a
protected station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and
these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a
feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the
great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches
the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its
ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.</p>
