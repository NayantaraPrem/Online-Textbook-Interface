<h3 class="section_title">3. Laws Governing The Sterility Of First
Crosses And Of Hybrids</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing
the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object
will be to see whether or not these laws indicate that species have
been specially endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their
crossing and blending together in utter confusion. The following
conclusions are drawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on
the hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain
how far they apply to animals, and, considering how scanty our
knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to
find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.</p>
<p>It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both
of first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect
fertility. It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation
can be shown; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be
given. When pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the
stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence
than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of fertility,
the pollen of different species applied to the stigma of some one
species of the same genus, yields a perfect gradation in the number
of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete
fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to
an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen
produces. So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have
produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of
the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases
a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of
the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither
earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering
of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient
fertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have
self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of
seeds up to perfect fertility.</p>
<p>The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to
cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very
sterile; but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a
first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced—two
classes of facts which are generally confounded together—is by no
means strict. There are many cases, in which two pure species, as
in the genus Verbascum, can be united with unusual facility, and
produce numerous hybrid offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably
sterile. On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed
very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at
last produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same
genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases
occur.</p>
<p>The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more
easily affected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure
species. But the fertility of first crosses is likewise innately
variable; for it is not always the same in degree when the same two
species are crossed under the same circumstances; it depends in
part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have
been chosen for the experiment. So it is with hybrids, for their
degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several
individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to
the same conditions.</p>
<p>By the term systematic affinity is meant, the general
resemblance between species in structure and constitution. Now the
fertility of first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them,
is largely governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly
shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by
systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very
closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the
correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of
crossing is by no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given
of very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with
extreme difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species
which unite with the utmost facility. In the same family there may
be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many species can most
readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene, in which the most
persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close
species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the same genus,
we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many species
of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of
almost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata, which
is not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to
fertilise, or to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species
of Nicotiana. Many analogous facts could be given.</p>
<p>No one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of
difference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent
two species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely
different in habit and general appearance, and having strongly
marked differences in every part of the flower, even in the pollen,
in the fruit, and in the cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and
perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting
different stations and fitted for extremely different climates, can
often be crossed with ease.</p>
<p>By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for
instance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and
then a mare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to
have been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible
difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases
are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two
species to cross is often completely independent of their
systematic affinity, that is of any difference in their structure
or constitution, excepting in their reproductive systems. The
diversity of the result in reciprocal crosses between the same two
species was long ago observed by Kolreuter. To give an instance:
Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M.
longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;
but Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight
following years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the
pollen of M. jalapa, and utterly failed. Several other equally
striking cases could be given. Thuret has observed the same fact
with certain sea-weeds or Fuci. Gartner, moreover, found that this
difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely
common in a lesser degree. He has observed it even between closely
related forms (as Matthiola annua and glabra) which many botanists
rank only as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact that hybrids
raised from reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of the
very same two species, the one species having first been used as
the father and then as the mother, though they rarely differ in
external characters, yet generally differ in fertility in a small,
and occasionally in a high degree.</p>
<p>Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for
instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with
other species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable
power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but
these two powers do not at all necessarily go together. There are
certain hybrids which, instead of having, as is usual, an
intermediate character between their two parents, always closely
resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like
one of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions
extremely sterile. So again among hybrids which are usually
intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and
abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one
of their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly
sterile, even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same
capsule have a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show
how completely the fertility of a hybrid may be independent of its
external resemblance to either pure parent.</p>
<p>Considering the several rules now given, which govern the
fertility of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms,
which must be considered as good and distinct species, are united,
their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even
to fertility under certain conditions in excess; that their
fertility, besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and
unfavourable conditions, is innately variable; that it is by no
means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the
hybrids produced from this cross; that the fertility of hybrids is
not related to the degree in which they resemble in external
appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of making a
first cross between any two species is not always governed by their
systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This
latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result
of reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according
as the one species or the other is used as the father or the
mother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the
widest possible difference, in the facility of effecting an union.
The hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often
differ in fertility.</p>
<p>Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species
have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming
confounded in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be
so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed,
all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep
from blending together? Why should the degree of sterility be
innately variable in the individuals of the same species? Why
should some species cross with facility and yet produce very
sterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty,
and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? Why should there often be
so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between
the same two species? Why, it may even be asked, has the production
of hybrids been permitted? To grant to species the special power of
producing hybrids, and then to stop their further propagation by
different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to the
facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange
arrangement.</p>
<p>The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me
clearly to indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and
of hybrids, is simply incidental or dependent on unknown
differences in their reproductive systems; the differences being of
so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses
between the same two species, the male sexual element of the one
will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other,
but not in a reversed direction. It will be advisable to explain a
little more fully, by an example, what I mean by sterility being
incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed
quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on
another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I
presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a SPECIALLY
endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on
differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We can
sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from
differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood,
in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.; but in a
multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. Great
diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the other
herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and
adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent
the two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting,
the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been
able to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct families;
and, on the other hand, closely allied species and varieties of the
same species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with
ease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means
absolutely governed by systematic affinity. Although many distinct
genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other
cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. The
pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked
as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the
same genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with
different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different
varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the
plum.</p>
<p>As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference
in different INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so
Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of
the same two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal
crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from
equal, so it sometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for
instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant
will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.</p>
<p>We have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their
reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case
from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their
reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of
cases run to a large extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in
grafting; for Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which
seeded freely on their own roots, and which could be grafted with
no great difficulty on a fourth species, when thus grafted were
rendered barren. On the other hand, certain species of Sorbus, when
grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on
their own roots. We are reminded by this latter fact of the
extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, etc., which seed
much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct
species than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.</p>
<p>We thus see that, although there is a clear and great difference
between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the
male and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there
is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of
crossing distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and
complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted
on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their
vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws
governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown
differences in their reproductive systems. These differences in
both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might have been
expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of
resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted
to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to indicate that the
greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various
species has been a special endowment; although in the case of
crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and
stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is
unimportant for their welfare.</p>
