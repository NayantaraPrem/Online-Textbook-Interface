<h3 class="section_title">9. Secondary Sexual Characters
Variable</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I think it will be admitted by naturalists, without my entering
on details, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable.
It will also be admitted that species of the same group differ from
each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than
in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the
amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in
which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the
amount of difference between the females. The cause of the original
variability of these characters is not manifest; but we can see why
they should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as
others, for they are accumulated by sexual selection, which is less
rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail
death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males.
Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual
characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have
had a wide scope for action, and may thus have succeeded in giving
to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in
these than in other respects.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between
the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the
very same parts of the organisation in which the species of the
same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in
illustration the first two instances which happen to stand on my
list; and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual
nature, the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of
joints in the tarsi is a character common to very large groups of
beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the number
varies greatly and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of
the same species. Again in the fossorial hymenoptera, the neuration
of the wings is a character of the highest importance, because
common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs
in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same
species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute
crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law. "In
Pontella, for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly
by the anterior antennae and by the fifth pair of legs: the
specific differences also are principally given by these organs."
This relation has a clear meaning on my view: I look at all the
species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the
same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one species.
Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common
progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable;
variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken
advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the
several places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the
two sexes of the same species to each other, or to fit the males to
struggle with other males for the possession of the females.</p>
<p>Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of
specific characters, or those which distinguish species from
species, than of generic characters, or those which are possessed
by all the species; that the frequent extreme variability of any
part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in
comparison with the same part in its congeners; and the slight
degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be
developed, if it be common to a whole group of species; that the
great variability of secondary sexual characters and their great
difference in closely allied species; that secondary sexual and
ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same
parts of the organisation, are all principles closely connected
together. All being mainly due to the species of the same group
being the descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they have
inherited much in common, to parts which have recently and largely
varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which
have long been inherited and have not varied, to natural selection
having more or less completely, according to the lapse of time,
overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability,
to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection, and
to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural
and sexual selection, and thus having been adapted for secondary
sexual, and for ordinary purposes.</p>
