<div class="text">
<p>Since Einstein has cut loose from the ether, he lacks this
canvas, and therewith, at the first glance, also loses the
possibility of fixing the positions of the heavenly bodies and
mathematically describing their movement—i.e., by giving
comparisons that define the positions at every moment. How Einstein
has overcome this difficulty may be somewhat elucidated through a
simple illustration.</p>
<p>On the surface of the earth the attraction of gravitation causes
all bodies to fall along vertical lines, and, indeed, when one
omits the resistance of the air, with an equally accelerated
movement; the velocity increases in equal degrees in equal
consecutive divisions of time at a rate that in this country gives
the velocity attained at the end of a second as 981 centimeters
(32.2 feet) per second. The number 981 defines the “acceleration in
the field of gravitation,” and this field is fully characterized by
that single number; with its help we can also calculate the
movement of an object hurled out in an arbitrary direction. In
order to measure the acceleration we let the body drop alongside of
a vertical measure set solidly on the ground; on this scale we read
at every moment the figure that indicates the height, the only
co-ordinate that is of importance in this rectilinear movement. Now
we ask what would we be able to see if the measure were not bound
solidly to the earth, if it, let us suppose, moved down or up with
the place where it is located and where we are ourselves. If in
this case the speed were constant, then, and this is in accord with
the special theory of relativity, there would be no motion observed
at all; we should again find an acceleration of 981 for a falling
body. It would be different if the measure moved with changeable
velocity.</p>
<p>If it went down with a constant acceleration of 981 itself, then
an object could remain permanently at the same point on the
measure, or could move up or down itself alongside of it, with
constant speed. The relative movement of the body with regard to
the measure should be without acceleration, and if we had to judge
only by what we observed in the spot where we were and which was
falling itself, then we should get the impression that there was no
gravitation at all. If the measure goes down with an acceleration
equal to a half or a third of what it just was, then the relative
motion of the body will, of course, be accelerated, but we should
find the increase in velocity per second one-half or two-thirds of
981. If, finally, we let the measure rise with a uniformly
accelerated movement, then we shall find a greater acceleration
than 981 for the body itself.</p>
<p>Thus we see that we, also when the measure is not attached to
the earth, disregarding its displacement, may describe the motion
of the body in respect to the measure always in the same
way—<em>i.e.</em>, as one uniformly accelerated, as we ascribe now
and again a fixed value to the acceleration of the sphere of
gravitation, in a particular case the value of zero.</p>
<p>Of course, in the case here under consideration the use of a
measure fixed immovably upon the earth should merit all
recommendation. But in the spaces of the solar system we have, now
that we have abandoned the ether, no such support. We can no longer
establish a system of co-ordinates, like the one just mentioned, in
a universal intermediate matter, and if we were to arrive in one
way or another at a definite system of lines crossing each other in
three directions, then we should be able to use just as well
another similar system that in respect to the first moves this or
that way. We should also be able to remodel the system of
co-ordinates in all kinds of ways, for example by extension or
compression. That in all these cases for fixed bodies that do not
participate in the movement or the remodelling of the system other
co-ordinates will be read off again and again is clear.</p>
