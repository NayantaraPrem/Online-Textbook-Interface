<h3 class="section_title">5. Development And Embryology</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of
natural history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one
is familiar, are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but
the transformations are in reality numerous and gradual, though
concealed. A certain ephemerous insect (Chloeon) during its
development, moults, as shown by Sir J. Lubbock, above twenty
times, and each time undergoes a certain amount of change; and in
this case we see the act of metamorphosis performed in a primary
and gradual manner. Many insects, and especially certain
crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be
effected during development. Such changes, however, reach their
acme in the so- called alternate generations of some of the lower
animals. It is, for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate
branching coralline, studded with polypi, and attached to a
submarine rock, should produce, first by budding and then by
transverse division, a host of huge floating jelly- fishes; and
that these should produce eggs, from which are hatched swimming
animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and become developed
into branching corallines; and so on in an endless cycle. The
belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate
generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly
strengthened by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly,
namely the Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these
others, which finally are developed into mature males and females,
propagating their kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.</p>
<p>It may be worth notice that when Wagner's remarkable discovery
was first announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for
the larvae of this fly having acquired the power of a sexual
reproduction. As long as the case remained unique no answer could
be given. But already Grimm has shown that another fly, a
Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the same manner, and he
believes that this occurs frequently in the order. It is the pupa,
and not the larva, of the Chironomus which has this power; and
Grimm further shows that this case, to a certain extent, "unites
that of the Cecidomyia with the parthenogenesis of the Coccidae;"
the term parthenogenesis implying that the mature females of the
Coccidae are capable of producing fertile eggs without the
concourse of the male. Certain animals belonging to several classes
are now known to have the power of ordinary reproduction at an
unusually early age; and we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic
reproduction by gradual steps to an earlier and earlier
age—Chironomus showing us an almost exactly intermediate stage,
viz., that of the pupa—and we can perhaps account for the
marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that various parts in the same
individual, which are exactly alike during an early embryonic
period, become widely different and serve for widely different
purposes in the adult state. So again it has been shown that
generally the embryos of the most distinct species belonging to the
same class are closely similar, but become, when fully developed,
widely dissimilar. A better proof of this latter fact cannot be
given than the statement by Von Baer that "the embryos of mammalia,
of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are in the
earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and
in the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact,
that we can often distinguish the embryos only by their size. In my
possession are two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have
omitted to attach, and at present I am quite unable to say to what
class they belong. They may be lizards or small birds, or very
young mammalia, so complete is the similarity in the mode of
formation of the head and trunk in these animals. The extremities,
however, are still absent in these embryos. But even if they had
existed in the earliest stage of their development we should learn
nothing, for the feet of lizards and mammals, the wings and feet of
birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise from the
same fundamental form." The larvae of most crustaceans, at
corresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other,
however different the adults may become; and so it is with very
many other animals. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance
occasionally lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same
genus, and of allied genera, often resemble each other in their
immature plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the young of
the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species when adult
are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes or spots can be
plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion and the puma. We
occasionally, though rarely, see something of the same kind in
plants; thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first
leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided like
the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.</p>
<p>The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely
different animals within the same class resemble each other, often
have no direct relation to their conditions of existence. We
cannot, for instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata
the peculiar loop-like courses of the arteries near the branchial
slits are related to similar conditions—in the young mammal which
is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird
which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water.
We have no more reason to believe in such a relation than we have
to believe that the similar bones in the hand of a man, wing of a
bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar conditions of
life. No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of a lion, or
the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these
animals.</p>
<p>The case, however, is different when an animal, during any part
of its embryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself.
The period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but
whenever it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions
of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal.
In how important a manner this has acted, has recently been well
shown by Sir J. Lubbock in his remarks on the close similarity of
the larvae of some insects belonging to very different orders, and
on the dissimilarity of the larvae of other insects within the same
order, according to their habits of life. Owing to such adaptations
the similarity of the larvae of allied animals is sometimes greatly
obscured; especially when there is a division of labour during the
different stages of development, as when the same larva has during
one stage to search for food, and during another stage has to
search for a place of attachment. Cases can even be given of the
larvae of allied species, or groups of species, differing more from
each other than do the adults. In most cases, however, the larvae,
though active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of common
embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of this:
even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was a
crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable
manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the
pedunculated and sessile, though differing widely in external
appearance, have larvae in all their stages barely
distinguishable.</p>
<p>The embryo in the course of development generally rises in
organisation. I use this expression, though I am aware that it is
hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by organisation
being higher or lower. But no one probably will dispute that the
butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In some cases, however,
the mature animal must be considered as lower in the scale than the
larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again
to cirripedes: the larvae in the first stage have three pairs of
locomotive organs, a simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth,
with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. In
the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies,
they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a
pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennae;
but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their
function at this stage is, to search out by their well-developed
organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a
proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final
metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life:
their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again
obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and
their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple
eye-spot. In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be
considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they
were in the larval condition. But in some genera the larvae become
developed into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or
into what I have called complemental males; and in the latter the
development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere
sack, which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth,
stomach, and every other organ of importance, excepting those for
reproduction.</p>
<p>We are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure
between the embryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at
this difference as in some necessary manner contingent on growth.
But there is no reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the
fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all their
parts in proper proportion, as soon as any part became visible. In
some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups
this is the case, and the embryo does not at any period differ
widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to
cuttle-fish, "there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character
is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed."
Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having their
proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great
classes pass through considerable and often great changes during
their development. Spiders, again, barely undergo any
metamorphosis. The larvae of most insects pass through a worm-like
stage, whether they are active and adapted to diversified habits,
or are inactive from being placed in the midst of proper nutriment,
or from being fed by their parents; but in some few cases, as in
that of Aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings of the
development of this insect, by Professor Huxley, we see hardly any
trace of the vermiform stage.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which
fail. Thus, Fritz Muller has made the remarkable discovery that
certain shrimp-like crustaceans (allied to Penoeus) first appear
under the simple nauplius- form, and after passing through two or
more zoea-stages, and then through the mysis-stage, finally acquire
their mature structure: now in the whole great malacostracan order,
to which these crustaceans belong, no other member is as yet known
to be first developed under the nauplius-form, though many appear
as zoeas; nevertheless Muller assigns reasons for his belief, that
if there had been no suppression of development, all these
crustaceans would have appeared as nauplii.</p>
<p>How, then, can we explain these several facts in
embryology—namely, the very general, though not universal,
difference in structure between the embryo and the adult; the
various parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately
become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes, being at an
early period of growth alike; the common, but not invariable,
resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most distinct
species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while within
the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either
at that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvae
which have to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted
to the surrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain
larvae standing higher in the scale of organisation than the mature
animal into which they are developed? I believe that all these
facts can be explained as follows.</p>
<p>It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the
embryo at a very early period, that slight variations or individual
differences necessarily appear at an equally early period. We have
little evidence on this head, but what we have certainly points the
other way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and
various fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time
after birth, what will be the merits and demerits of their young
animals. We see this plainly in our own children; we cannot tell
whether a child will be tall or short, or what its precise features
will be. The question is not, at what period of life any variation
may have been caused, but at what period the effects are displayed.
The cause may have acted, and I believe often has acted, on one or
both parents before the act of generation. It deserves notice that
it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it is
nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its
characters are acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would
not signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food by
having a much-curved beak whether or not while young it possessed a
beak of this shape, as long as it was fed by its parents.</p>
<p>I have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any
variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a
corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only
appear at corresponding ages; for instance, peculiarities in the
caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again,
in the full-grown horns of cattle. But variations which, for all
that we can see might have appeared either earlier or later in
life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding age in the
offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is invariably
the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of variations
(taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an
earlier age in the child than in the parent.</p>
<p>These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally
appear at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a
corresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the
above specified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look
to a few analogous cases in our domestic varieties. Some authors
who have written on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bull-dog,
though so different, are really closely allied varieties, descended
from the same wild stock, hence I was curious to see how far their
puppies differed from each other. I was told by breeders that they
differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the
eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the
old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies
had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional
difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and
race-horses—breeds which have been almost wholly formed by
selection under domestication—differed as much as the full-grown
animals; but having had careful measurements made of the dams and
of three-days-old colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that
this is by no means the case.</p>
<p>As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are
descended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons
within twelve hours after being hatched. I carefully measured the
proportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width
of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length
of leg, in the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts,
barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now, some of these birds,
when mature, differ in so extraordinary a manner in the length and
form of beak, and in other characters, that they would certainly
have been ranked as distinct genera if found in a state of nature.
But when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in
a row, though most of them could just be distinguished, the
proportional differences in the above specified points were
incomparably less than in the full-grown birds. Some characteristic
points of difference—for instance, that of the width of mouth—could
hardly be detected in the young. But there was one remarkable
exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler
differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the other
breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult
stage.</p>
<p>These facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers
select their dogs, horses, pigeons, etc., for breeding, when nearly
grown up. They are indifferent whether the desired qualities are
acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal
possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of
the pigeons, show that the characteristic differences which have
been accumulated by man's selection, and which give value to his
breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period of life, and
are inherited at a corresponding not early period. But the case of
the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed its
proper characters, proves that this is not the universal rule; for
here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an
earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have
been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.</p>
<p>Now, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of
nature. Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient
form and modified through natural selection for different habits.
Then, from the many slight successive variations having supervened
in the several species at a not early age, and having been
inherited at a corresponding age, the young will have been but
little modified, and they will still resemble each other much more
closely than do the adults, just as we have seen with the breeds of
the pigeon. We may extend this view to widely distinct structures
and to whole classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which once
served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have become, through a
long course of modification, adapted in one descendant to act as
hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; but on the above
two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in
the embryos of these several forms; although in each form the
fore-limb will differ greatly in the adult state. Whatever
influence long continued use or disuse may have had in modifying
the limbs or other parts of any species, this will chiefly or
solely have affected it when nearly mature, when it was compelled
to use its full powers to gain its own living; and the effects thus
produced will have been transmitted to the offspring at a
corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will not be
modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree, through the
effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.</p>
<p>With some animals the successive variations may have supervened
at a very early period of life, or the steps may have been
inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first occurred.
In either of these cases the young or embryo will closely resemble
the mature parent-form, as we have seen with the short-faced
tumbler. And this is the rule of development in certain whole
groups, or in certain sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish,
land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and some members of
the great class of insects. With respect to the final cause of the
young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis, we can
see that this would follow from the following contingencies:
namely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for
their own wants, and from their following the same habits of life
with their parents; for in this case it would be indispensable for
their existence that they should be modified in the same manner as
their parents. Again, with respect to the singular fact that many
terrestrial and fresh-water animals do not undergo any
metamorphosis, while marine members of the same groups pass through
various transformations, Fritz Muller has suggested that the
process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal to live on the
land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be greatly
simplified by its not passing through any larval stage; for it is
not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and
mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life,
would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other
organisms. In this case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and
earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured by natural
selection; and all traces of former metamorphoses would finally be
lost.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to
follow habits of life slightly different from those of the
parent-form, and consequently to be constructed on a slightly
different plan, or if it profited a larva already different from
its parent to change still further, then, on the principle of
inheritance at corresponding ages, the young or the larvae might be
rendered by natural selection more and more different from their
parents to any conceivable extent. Differences in the larva might,
also, become correlated with successive stages of its development;
so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to differ greatly
from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many
animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in
which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be
useless; and in this case the metamorphosis would be
retrograde.</p>
<p>From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of
structure in the young, in conformity with changed habits of life,
together with inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come
to pass through stages of development, perfectly distinct from the
primordial condition of their adult progenitors. Most of our best
authorities are now convinced that the various larval and pupal
stages of insects have thus been acquired through adaptation, and
not through inheritance from some ancient form. The curious case of
Sitaris—a beetle which passes through certain unusual stages of
development—will illustrate how this might occur. The first larval
form is described by M. Fabre, as an active, minute insect,
furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four eyes. These
larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male bees
emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the
females, the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the
females while paired with the males. As soon as the female bee
deposits her eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells,
the larvae of the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them.
Afterwards they undergo a complete change; their eyes disappear;
their legs and antennae become rudimentary, and they feed on honey;
so that they now more closely resemble the ordinary larvae of
insects; ultimately they undergo a further transformation, and
finally emerge as the perfect beetle. Now, if an insect, undergoing
transformations like those of the Sitaris, were to become the
progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of
development of the new class would be widely different from that of
our existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly would
not represent the former condition of any adult and ancient
form.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals
the embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely,
the condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult
state. In the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully
distinct from each other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes,
entomostraca, and even the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae
under the nauplius-form; and as these larvae live and feed in the
open sea, and are not adapted for any peculiar habits of life, and
from other reasons assigned by Fritz Muller, it is probable that at
some very remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the
Nauplius, existed, and subsequently produced, along several
divergent lines of descent, the above-named great Crustacean
groups. So again, it is probable, from what we know of the embryos
of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals are the
modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was
furnished in its adult state with branchiae, a swim- bladder, four
fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic
life.</p>
<p>As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever
lived, can be arranged within a few great classes; and as all
within each class have, according to our theory, been connected
together by fine gradations, the best, and, if our collections were
nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be
genealogical; descent being the hidden bond of connexion which
naturalists have been seeking under the term of the Natural System.
On this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most
naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for
classification than that of the adult. In two or more groups of
animals, however much they may differ from each other in structure
and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through closely
similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all
descended from one parent- form, and are therefore closely related.
Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of
descent; but dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove
discommunity of descent, for in one of two groups the developmental
stages may have been suppressed, or may have been so greatly
modified through adaptation to new habits of life as to be no
longer recognisable. Even in groups, in which the adults have been
modified to an extreme degree, community of origin is often
revealed by the structure of the larvae; we have seen, for
instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish,
are at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of
crustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the
structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group,
we can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their
adult state the embryos of existing species of the same class.
Agassiz believes this to be a universal law of nature; and we may
hope hereafter to see the law proved true. It can, however, be
proved true only in those cases in which the ancient state of the
progenitor of the group has not been wholly obliterated, either by
successive variations having supervened at a very early period of
growth, or by such variations having been inherited at an earlier
age than that at which they first appeared. It should also be borne
in mind, that the law may be true, but yet, owing to the geological
record not extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long
period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration. The law will not
strictly hold good in those cases in which an ancient form became
adapted in its larval state to some special line of life, and
transmitted the same larval state to a whole group of descendants;
for such larval state will not resemble any still more ancient form
in its adult state.</p>
<p>Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which
are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of
variations in the many descendants from some one ancient
progenitor, having appeared at a not very early period of life, and
having been inherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises
greatly in interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more
or less obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval
state, of all the members of the same great class.</p>
