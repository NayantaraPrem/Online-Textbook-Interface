<h3 class="section_title">2. Sexual Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in
one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt
it will be under nature. Thus it is rendered possible for the two
sexes to be modified through natural selection in relation to
different habits of life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex
to be modified in relation to the other sex, as commonly occurs.
This leads me to say a few words on what I have called sexual
selection. This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for
existence in relation to other organic beings or to external
conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex,
generally the males, for the possession of the other sex. The
result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no
offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than
natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which
are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most
progeny. But in many cases victory depends not so much on general
vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A
hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving
numerous offspring. Sexual selection, by always allowing the victor
to breed, might surely give indomitable courage, length of spur,
and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, in nearly
the same manner as does the brutal cockfighter by the careful
selection of his best cocks. How low in the scale of nature the law
of battle descends I know not; male alligators have been described
as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a
war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have
been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes
bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of
certain hymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that
inimitable observer M. Fabre, fighting for a particular female who
sits by, an apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and
then retires with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps, severest
between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest
provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are
already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of
defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane
of the lion, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield
may be as important for victory as the sword or spear.</p>
<p>Among birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.
All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is
the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract,
by singing, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of
paradise, and some others, congregate, and successive males display
with the most elaborate care, and show off in the best manner,
their gorgeous plumage; they likewise perform strange antics before
the females, which, standing by as spectators, at last choose the
most attractive partner. Those who have closely attended to birds
in confinement well know that they often take individual
preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how a
pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. I
cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if man can in a
short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams,
according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to
doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of
generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to
their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. Some
well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of male and female
birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can partly be
explained through the action of sexual selection on variations
occurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or
to both sexes at corresponding ages; but I have not space here to
enter on this subject.</p>
<p>Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any
animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in
structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly
caused by sexual selection: that is, by individual males having
had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other
males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms; which they
have transmitted to their male offspring alone. Yet, I would not
wish to attribute all sexual differences to this agency: for we see
in our domestic animals peculiarities arising and becoming attached
to the male sex, which apparently have not been augmented through
selection by man. The tuft of hair on the breast of the wild
turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it is doubtful whether it can
be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird; indeed, had the tuft
appeared under domestication it would have been called a
monstrosity.</p>
