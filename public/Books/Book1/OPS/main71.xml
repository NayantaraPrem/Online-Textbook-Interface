<p>The view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species,
when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in
order to prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at
first highly probable, for species living together could hardly
have been kept distinct had they been capable of freely crossing.
The subject is in many ways important for us, more especially as
the sterility of species when first crossed, and that of their
hybrid offspring, cannot have been acquired, as I shall show, by
the preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. It
is an incidental result of differences in the reproductive systems
of the parent-species.</p>
<p>In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large
extent fundamentally different, have generally been confounded;
namely, the sterility of species when first crossed, and the
sterility of the hybrids produced from them.</p>
<p>Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a
perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or
no offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive
organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state
of the male element in both plants and animals; though the
formative organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the
microscope reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements which
go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are
either not at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. This
distinction is important, when the cause of the sterility, which is
common to the two cases, has to be considered. The distinction
probably has been slurred over, owing to the sterility in both
cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond the province
of our reasoning powers.</p>
<p>The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or
believed to be descended from common parents, when crossed, and
likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, with
reference to my theory, of equal importance with the sterility of
species; for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between
varieties and species.</p>
