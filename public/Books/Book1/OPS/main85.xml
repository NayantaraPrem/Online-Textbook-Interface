<h3 class="section_title">6. On The Sudden Appearance Of Groups Of
Allied Species In The Lowest Known Fossiliferous Strata</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>There is another and allied difficulty, which is much more
serious. I allude to the manner in which species belonging to
several of the main divisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear
in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments
which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same
group are descended from a single progenitor, apply with equal
force to the earliest known species. For instance, it cannot be
doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian trilobites are descended
from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the
Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly from any known
animal. Some of the most ancient animals, as the Nautilus, Lingula,
etc., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on our
theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of
all the species belonging to the same groups which have
subsequently appeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate
in character.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that
before the lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods
elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole
interval from the Cambrian age to the present day; and that during
these vast periods the world swarmed with living creatures. Here we
encounter a formidable objection; for it seems doubtful whether the
earth, in a fit state for the habitation of living creatures, has
lasted long enough. Sir W. Thompson concludes that the
consolidation of the crust can hardly have occurred less than
twenty or more than four hundred million years ago, but probably
not less than ninety-eight or more than two hundred million years.
These very wide limits show how doubtful the data are; and other
elements may have hereafter to be introduced into the problem. Mr.
Croll estimates that about sixty million years have elapsed since
the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small amount of
organic change since the commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears
a very short time for the many and great mutations of life, which
have certainly occurred since the Cambrian formation; and the
previous one hundred and forty million years can hardly be
considered as sufficient for the development of the varied forms of
life which already existed during the Cambrian period. It is,
however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the world
at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent
changes in its physical conditions than those now occurring; and
such changes would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding
rate in the organisms which then existed.</p>
<p>To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits
belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian
system, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several eminent
geologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, were until
recently convinced that we beheld in the organic remains of the
lowest Silurian stratum the first dawn of life. Other highly
competent judges, as Lyell and E. Forbes, have disputed this
conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion of the
world is known with accuracy. Not very long ago M. Barrande added
another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar species,
beneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower down
in the Lower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales
beds rich in trilobites, and containing various molluscs and
annelids. The presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter,
even in some of the lowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at
these periods; and the existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian
formation of Canada is generally admitted. There are three great
series of strata beneath the Silurian system in Canada, in the
lowest of which the Eozoon is found. Sir W. Logan states that their
"united thickness may possibly far surpass that of all the
succeeding rocks, from the base of the palaeozoic series to the
present time. We are thus carried back to a period so remote, that
the appearance of the so-called primordial fauna (of Barrande) may
by some be considered as a comparatively modern event." The Eozoon
belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes of animals, but
is highly organised for its class; it existed in countless numbers,
and, as Dr. Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on other minute
organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers. Thus the
words, which I wrote in 1859, about the existence of living beings
long before the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same with
those since used by Sir W. Logan, have proved true. Nevertheless,
the difficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast
piles of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very
great. It does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have
been quite worn away by denudation, or that their fossils have been
wholly obliterated by metamorphic action, for if this had been the
case we should have found only small remnants of the formations
next succeeding them in age, and these would always have existed in
a partially metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we
possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia
and in North America, do not support the view that the older a
formation is the more invariably it has suffered extreme denudation
and metamorphism.</p>
<p>The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly
urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. To
show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give
the following hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains
which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the
several formations of Europe and of the United States; and from the
amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are
composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or
tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the
neighbourhood of the now existing continents of Europe and North
America. This same view has since been maintained by Agassiz and
others. But we do not know what was the state of things in the
intervals between the several successive formations; whether Europe
and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land,
or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not
deposited, or as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.</p>
<p>Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as
the land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one
truly oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this
can be called a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford
even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary formation. Hence, we
may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and secondary
periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where
our oceans now extend; for had they existed, palaeozoic and
secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated
from sediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been
at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which
must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If,
then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that,
where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest
period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that
where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed,
subjected, no doubt, to great oscillations of level, since the
Cambrian period. The coloured map appended to my volume on Coral
Reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly
areas of subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of
oscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. But
we have no reason to assume that things have thus remained from the
beginning of the world. Our continents seem to have been formed by
a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of
elevation. But may not the areas of preponderant movement have
changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent to the
Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now
spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our
continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that
if, for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted
into a continent we should there find sedimentary formations, in
recognisable condition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing
such to have been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that
strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the
earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of
superincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic
action than strata which have always remained nearer to the
surface. The immense areas in some parts of the world, for instance
in South America, of naked metamorphic rocks, which must have been
heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to require
some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see in
these large areas the many formations long anterior to the Cambrian
epoch in a completely metamorphosed and denuded condition.</p>
<p>The several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we
find in our geological formations many links between the species
which now exist and which formerly existed, we do not find
infinitely numerous fine transitional forms closely joining them
all together. The sudden manner in which several groups of species
first appear in our European formations, the almost entire absence,
as at present known, of formations rich in fossils beneath the
Cambrian strata, are all undoubtedly of the most serious nature. We
see this in the fact that the most eminent palaeontologists,
namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande, Pictet, Falconer, E. Forbes,
etc., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison,
Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the
immutability of species. But Sir Charles Lyell now gives the
support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most
geologists and palaeontologists are much shaken in their former
belief. Those who believe that the geological record is in any
degree perfect, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my
part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the geological
record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a
changing dialect. Of this history we possess the last volume alone,
relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here
and there a short chapter has been preserved, and of each page,
only here and there a few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing
language, more or less different in the successive chapters, may
represent the forms of life, which are entombed in our consecutive
formations, and which falsely appear to have been abruptly
introduced. On this view the difficulties above discussed are
greatly diminished or even disappear.</p>
