<h3 class="section_title">3. On The Poorness Of Palaeontological
Collections</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Now let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry
display we behold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted
by every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward
Forbes, should never be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil
species are known and named from single and often broken specimens,
or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only a small
portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored,
and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made
every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be
preserved. Shells and bones decay and disappear when left on the
bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. We probably
take a quite erroneous view, when we assume that sediment is being
deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate
sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout
an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint
of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a
formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time,
by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having
suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on
the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an
unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in
sand or gravel, will, when the beds are upraised, generally be
dissolved by the percolation of rain water charged with carbonic
acid. Some of the many kinds of animals which live on the beach
between high and low water mark seem to be rarely preserved. For
instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of
sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite
numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a
single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and this
has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has
hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is known that
the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period. Lastly, many
great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their
accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without
our being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking
instances is that of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale
and sandstone, several thousand, occasionally even six thousand
feet in thickness, and extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna
to Switzerland; and although this great mass has been most
carefully searched, no fossils, except a few vegetable remains,
have been found.</p>
<p>With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during
the Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state
that our evidence is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For
instance, until recently not a land-shell was known belonging to
either of these vast periods, with the exception of one species
discovered by Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson in the carboniferous
strata of North America; but now land-shells have been found in the
lias. In regard to mammiferous remains, a glance at the historical
table published in Lyell's Manual, will bring home the truth, how
accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of
detail. Nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large
a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered
either in caves or in lacustrine deposits; and that not a cave or
true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary
or palaeozoic formations.</p>
<p>But the imperfection in the geological record largely results
from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing;
namely, from the several formations being separated from each other
by wide intervals of time. This doctrine has been emphatically
admitted by many geologists and palaeontologists, who, like E.
Forbes, entirely disbelieve in the change of species. When we see
the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow them
in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely
consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison's
great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country
between the superimposed formations; so it is in North America, and
in many other parts of the world. The most skilful geologist, if
his attention had been confined exclusively to these large
territories, would never have suspected that during the periods
which were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of
sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had
elsewhere been accumulated. And if, in every separate territory,
hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has
elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that this
could nowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the
mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally
implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands,
whence the sediment was derived, accord with the belief of vast
intervals of time having elapsed between each formation.</p>
<p>We can, I think, see why the geological formations of each
region are almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not
followed each other in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me
more when examining many hundred miles of the South American
coasts, which have been upraised several hundred feet within the
recent period, than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently
extensive to last for even a short geological period. Along the
whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna,
tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no record of several
successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to
a distant age. A little reflection will explain why, along the
rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive
formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found,
though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from
the enormous degradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy
streams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is that the
littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as
soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the
land within the grinding action of the coast-waves.</p>
<p>We may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in
extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand
the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during
subsequent oscillations of level, as well as the subsequent
subaerial degradation. Such thick and extensive accumulations of
sediment may be formed in two ways; either in profound depths of
the sea, in which case the bottom will not be inhabited by so many
and such varied forms of life as the more shallow seas; and the
mass when upraised will give an imperfect record of the organisms
which existed in the neighbourhood during the period of its
accumulation. Or sediment may be deposited to any thickness and
extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In
this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of
sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and
favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich fossiliferous
formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large amount of
denudation, may be formed.</p>
<p>I am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are
throughout the greater part of their thickness RICH IN FOSSILS,
have thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views
on this subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of geology,
and have been surprised to note how author after author, in
treating of this or that great formation, has come to the
conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. I may add,
that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of South
America, which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as
it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a distant
geological age, was deposited during a downward oscillation of
level, and thus gained considerable thickness.</p>
<p>All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has
undergone numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these
oscillations have affected wide spaces. Consequently, formations
rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist
subsequent degradation, will have been formed over wide spaces
during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of sediment
was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve
the remains before they had time to decay. On the other hand, as
long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK deposits
cannot have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the
most favourable to life. Still less can this have happened during
the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately,
the beds which were then accumulated will generally have been
destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the
coast-action.</p>
<p>These remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral
deposits. In the case of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that
within a large part of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth
varies from thirty or forty to sixty fathoms, a widely extended
formation might be formed during a period of elevation, and yet not
suffer excessively from denudation during its slow upheaval; but
the thickness of the formation could not be great, for owing to the
elevatory movement it would be less than the depth in which it was
formed; nor would the deposit be much consolidated, nor be capped
by overlying formations, so that it would run a good chance of
being worn away by atmospheric degradation and by the action of the
sea during subsequent oscillations of level. It has, however, been
suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the area, after
rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit formed
during the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards
become protected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for
a long period.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of
considerable horizontal extent have rarely been completely
destroyed. But all geologists, excepting the few who believe that
our present metamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the
primordial nucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks
have been stripped of their covering to an enormous extent. For it
is scarcely possible that such rocks could have been solidified and
crystallised while uncovered; but if the metamorphic action
occurred at profound depths of the ocean, the former protecting
mantle of rock may not have been very thick. Admitting then that
gneiss, mica-schist, granite, diorite, etc., were once necessarily
covered up, how can we account for the naked and extensive areas of
such rocks in many parts of the world, except on the belief that
they have subsequently been completely denuded of all overlying
strata? That such extensive areas do exist cannot be doubted: the
granitic region of Parime is described by Humboldt as being at
least nineteen times as large as Switzerland. South of the Amazon,
Boue colours an area composed of rocks of this nature as equal to
that of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British
Islands, all conjoined. This region has not been carefully
explored, but from the concurrent testimony of travellers, the
granitic area is very large: thus Von Eschwege gives a detailed
section of these rocks, stretching from Rio de Janeiro for 260
geographical miles inland in a straight line; and I travelled for
150 miles in another direction, and saw nothing but granitic rocks.
Numerous specimens, collected along the whole coast, from near Rio
de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a distance of 1,100
geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all belonged to
this class. Inland, along the whole northern bank of the Plata, I
saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of slightly
metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the
original capping of the granitic series. Turning to a well-known
region, namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in
Professor H.D. Rogers' beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by
cutting out and weighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic
(excluding the "semi-metamorphic") and granite rocks exceed, in the
proportion of 19 to 12.5, the whole of the newer Palaeozoic
formations. In many regions the metamorphic and granite rocks would
be found much more widely extended than they appear to be, if all
the sedimentary beds were removed which rest unconformably on them,
and which could not have formed part of the original mantle under
which they were crystallised. Hence, it is probable that in some
parts of the world whole formations have been completely denuded,
with not a wreck left behind.</p>
<p>One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of
elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of
the sea will be increased and new stations will often be formed—all
circumstances favourable, as previously explained, for the
formation of new varieties and species; but during such periods
there will generally be a blank in the geological record. On the
other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area and number of
inhabitants will decrease (excepting on the shores of a continent
when first broken up into an archipelago), and consequently during
subsidence, though there will be much extinction, few new varieties
or species will be formed; and it is during these very periods of
subsidence that the deposits which are richest in fossils have been
accumulated.</p>
