<h3 class="section_title">6. Special Difficulties Of The Theory Of
Natural Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any
organ could not have been produced by successive, small,
transitional gradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of
difficulty occur.</p>
<p>One of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are
often differently constructed from either the males or fertile
females; but this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The
electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty;
for it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous
organs have been produced. But this is not surprising, for we do
not even know of what use they are. In the gymnotus and torpedo
they no doubt serve as powerful means of defence, and perhaps for
securing prey; yet in the ray, as observed by Matteucci, an
analogous organ in the tail manifests but little electricity, even
when the animal is greatly irritated; so little that it can hardly
be of any use for the above purposes. Moreover, in the ray, besides
the organ just referred to, there is, as Dr. R. McDonnell has
shown, another organ near the head, not known to be electrical, but
which appears to be the real homologue of the electric battery in
the torpedo. It is generally admitted that there exists between
these organs and ordinary muscle a close analogy, in intimate
structure, in the distribution of the nerves, and in the manner in
which they are acted on by various reagents. It should, also, be
especially observed that muscular contraction is accompanied by an
electrical discharge; and, as Dr. Radcliffe insists, "in the
electrical apparatus of the torpedo during rest, there would seem
to be a charge in every respect like that which is met with in
muscle and nerve during the rest, and the discharge of the torpedo,
instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of the
discharge which attends upon the action of muscle and motor nerve."
Beyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation; but
as we know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we know
nothing about the habits and structure of the progenitors of the
existing electric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain
that no serviceable transitions are possible by which these organs
might have been gradually developed.</p>
<p>These organs appear at first to offer another and far more
serious difficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish,
of which several are widely remote in their affinities. When the
same organ is found in several members of the same class,
especially if in members having very different habits of life, we
may generally attribute its presence to inheritance from a common
ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to loss through
disuse or natural selection. So that, if the electric organs had
been inherited from some one ancient progenitor, we might have
expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related
to each other; but this is far from the case. Nor does geology at
all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly possessed electric
organs, which their modified descendants have now lost. But when we
look at the subject more closely, we find in the several fishes
provided with electric organs, that these are situated in different
parts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in the
arrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process
or means by which the electricity is excitedâ€”and lastly, in being
supplied with nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is
perhaps the most important of all the differences. Hence in the
several fishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be
considered as homologous, but only as analogous in function.
Consequently there is no reason to suppose that they have been
inherited from a common progenitor; for had this been the case they
would have closely resembled each other in all respects. Thus the
difficulty of an organ, apparently the same, arising in several
remotely allied species, disappears, leaving only the lesser yet
still great difficulty: namely, by what graduated steps these
organs have been developed in each separate group of fishes.</p>
<p>The luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to
widely different families, and which are situated in different
parts of the body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a
difficulty almost exactly parallel with that of the electric
organs. Other similar cases could be given; for instance in plants,
the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a
foot-stalk with an adhesive gland, is apparently the same in Orchis
and Asclepias, genera almost as remote as is possible among
flowering plants; but here again the parts are not homologous. In
all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the scale of
organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar organs,
it will be found that although the general appearance and function
of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences between
them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of Cephalopods
or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully alike;
and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance can
be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has
advanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to
see the force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed
of transparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for
throwing an image at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this
superficial resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity
between the eyes of cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by
consulting Hensen's admirable memoir on these organs in the
Cephalopoda. It is impossible for me here to enter on details, but
I may specify a few of the points of difference. The crystalline
lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists of two parts, placed one
behind the other like two lenses, both having a very different
structure and disposition to what occurs in the vertebrata. The
retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of the
elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within
the membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as
different as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points.
Hence it is not a little difficult to decide how far even the same
terms ought to be employed in describing the eyes of the
Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It is, of course, open to any one to
deny that the eye in either case could have been developed through
the natural selection of successive slight variations; but if this
be admitted in the one case it is clearly possible in the other;
and fundamental differences of structure in the visual organs of
two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance with this
view of their manner of formation. As two men have sometimes
independently hit on the same invention, so in the several
foregoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for the
good of each being, and taking advantage of all favourable
variations, has produced similar organs, as far as function is
concerned, in distinct organic beings, which owe none of their
structure in common to inheritance from a common progenitor.</p>
<p>Fritz Muller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in
this volume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line
of argument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species,
possessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the
water. In two of these families, which were more especially
examined by Muller, and which are nearly related to each other, the
species agree most closely in all important characters: namely in
their sense organs, circulating systems, in the position of the
tufts of hair within their complex stomachs, and lastly in the
whole structure of the water-breathing branchiae, even to the
microscopical hooks by which they are cleansed. Hence it might have
been expected that in the few species belonging to both families
which live on the land, the equally important air-breathing
apparatus would have been the same; for why should this one
apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made to differ,
while all the other important organs were closely similar, or
rather, identical.</p>
<p>Fritz Muller argues that this close similarity in so many points
of structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be
accounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the
vast majority of the species in the above two families, as well as
most other crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is
improbable in the highest degree that their common progenitor
should have been adapted for breathing air. Muller was thus led
carefully to examine the apparatus in the air-breathing species;
and he found it to differ in each in several important points, as
in the position of the orifices, in the manner in which they are
opened and closed, and in some accessory details. Now such
differences are intelligible, and might even have been expected, on
the supposition that species belonging to distinct families had
slowly become adapted to live more and more out of water, and to
breathe the air. For these species, from belonging to distinct
families, would have differed to a certain extent, and in
accordance with the principle that the nature of each variation
depends on two factors, viz., the nature of the organism and that
of the surrounding conditions, their variability assuredly would
not have been exactly the same. Consequently natural selection
would have had different materials or variations to work on, in
order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures
thus acquired would almost necessarily have differed. On the
hypothesis of separate acts of creation the whole case remains
unintelligible. This line of argument seems to have had great
weight in leading Fritz Muller to accept the views maintained by me
in this volume.</p>
<p>Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparede,
has argued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result.
He shows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridae), belonging to
distinct sub-families and families, which are furnished with
hair-claspers. These organs must have been independently developed,
as they could not have been inherited from a common progenitor; and
in the several groups they are formed by the modification of the
fore legs, of the hind legs, of the maxillae or lips, and of
appendages on the under side of the hind part of the body.</p>
<p>In the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same
function performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied,
by organs in appearance, though not in development, closely
similar. On the other hand, it is a common rule throughout nature
that the same end should be gained, even sometimes in the case of
closely related beings, by the most diversified means. How
differently constructed is the feathered wing of a bird and the
membrane-covered wing of a bat; and still more so the four wings of
a butterfly, the two wings of a fly, and the two wings with the
elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells are made to open and shut, but
on what a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the
long row of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple
ligament of a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their minuteness,
by their capsule being converted into a light balloon-like
envelope, by being embedded in pulp or flesh, formed of the most
diverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well as conspicuously
coloured, so as to attract and be devoured by birds, by having
hooks and grapnels of many kinds and serrated awns, so as to adhere
to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being furnished with wings and
plumes, as different in shape as they are elegant in structure, so
as to be wafted by every breeze. I will give one other instance:
for this subject of the same end being gained by the most
diversified means well deserves attention. Some authors maintain
that organic beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of
mere variety, almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature
is incredible. With plants having separated sexes, and with those
in which, though hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously
fall on the stigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation.
With several kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are
light and incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance
on to the stigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be
conceived. An almost equally simple, though very different plan
occurs in many plants in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few
drops of nectar, and is consequently visited by insects; and these
carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma.</p>
<p>From this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible
number of contrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in
essentially the same manner, but entailing changes in every part of
the flower. The nectar may be stored in variously shaped
receptacles, with the stamens and pistils modified in many ways,
sometimes forming trap-like contrivances, and sometimes capable of
neatly adapted movements through irritability or elasticity. From
such structures we may advance till we come to such a case of
extraordinary adaptation as that lately described by Dr. Cruger in
the Coryanthes. This orchid has part of its labellum or lower lip
hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost pure
water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above
it; and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a
spout on one side. The basal part of the labellum stands over the
bucket, and is itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two
lateral entrances; within this chamber there are curious fleshy
ridges. The most ingenious man, if he had not witnessed what takes
place, could never have imagined what purpose all these parts
serve. But Dr. Cruger saw crowds of large humble-bees visiting the
gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order to suck nectar, but
to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the bucket; in
doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket, and
their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were
compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or
overflow. Dr. Cruger saw a "continual procession" of bees thus
crawling out of their involuntary bath. The passage is narrow, and
is roofed over by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way
out, first rubs its back against the viscid stigma and then against
the viscid glands of the pollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus
glued to the back of the bee which first happens to crawl out
through the passage of a lately expanded flower, and are thus
carried away. Dr. Cruger sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with
a bee which he had killed before it had quite crawled out, with a
pollen-mass still fastened to its back. When the bee, thus
provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a second
time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls
out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into
contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower
is fertilised. Now at last we see the full use of every part of the
flower, of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of
water, which prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to
crawl out through the spout, and rub against the properly placed
viscid pollen-masses and the viscid stigma.</p>
<p>The construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid,
namely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same
end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those
of the Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this
they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or,
as I have called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched,
transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is
instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the
pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the right direction,
and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee. The
pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this
orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it
is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to
break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus
effecting fertilisation.</p>
<p>How, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other
instances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and
the multifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no
doubt is, as already remarked, that when two forms vary, which
already differ from each other in some slight degree, the
variability will not be of the same exact nature, and consequently
the results obtained through natural selection for the same general
purpose will not be the same. We should also bear in mind that
every highly developed organism has passed through many changes;
and that each modified structure tends to be inherited, so that
each modification will not readily be quite lost, but may be again
and again further altered. Hence, the structure of each part of
each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the sum of many
inherited changes, through which the species has passed during its
successive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of
life.</p>
<p>Finally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even
to conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at
their present state; yet, considering how small the proportion of
living and known forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been
astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no
transitional grade is known to lead. It is certainly true, that new
organs appearing as if created for some special purpose rarely or
never appear in any being; as indeed is shown by that old, but
somewhat exaggerated, canon in natural history of "Natura non facit
saltum." We meet with this admission in the writings of almost
every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well
expressed it, "Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in
innovation." Why, on the theory of Creation, should there be so
much variety and so little real novelty? Why should all the parts
and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been
separately created for its own proper place in nature, be so
commonly linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature
take a sudden leap from structure to structure? On the theory of
natural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not;
for natural selection acts only by taking advantage of slight
successive variations; she can never take a great and sudden leap,
but must advance by the short and sure, though slow steps.</p>
