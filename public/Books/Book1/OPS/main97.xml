<div class="text">
<p>Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I
can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important
facts. Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on
migration. A region now impassable to certain organisms from the
nature of its climate, might have been a high road for migration,
when the climate was different. I shall, however, presently have to
discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. Changes of level
in the land must also have been highly influential: a narrow
isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it
formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now blend
together, or may formerly have blended. Where the sea now extends,
land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even
continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions
to pass from one to the other. No geologist disputes that great
mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing
organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the
Atlantic must have been recently connected with Europe or Africa,
and Europe likewise with America. Other authors have thus
hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and united almost every
island with some mainland. If, indeed, the arguments used by Forbes
are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a single
island exists which has not recently been united to some continent.
This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the same
species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty;
but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting
such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing
species. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great
oscillations in the level of the land or sea; but not of such vast
changes in the position and extension of our continents, as to have
united them within the recent period to each other and to the
several intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the former
existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may
have served as halting places for plants and for many animals
during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans such sunken
islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing over
them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that
each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in
the course of time we know something definite about the means of
distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the
former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will
ever be proved that within the recent period most of our continents
which now stand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost
continuously united with each other, and with the many existing
oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution—such as the great
difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost
every continent—the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of
several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants—the degree
of affinity between the mammals inhabiting islands with those of
the nearest continent, being in part determined (as we shall
hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening ocean—these and
other such facts are opposed to the admission of such prodigious
geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessary
on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers. The
nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic
islands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former
continuity of continents. Nor does the almost universally volcanic
composition of such islands favour the admission that they are the
wrecks of sunken continents; if they had originally existed as
continental mountain ranges, some at least of the islands would
have been formed, like other mountain summits, of granite,
metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and other rocks, instead of
consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.</p>
<p>I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means,
but which more properly should be called occasional means of
distribution. I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical
works, this or that plant is often stated to be ill adapted for
wide dissemination; but the greater or less facilities for
transport across the sea may be said to be almost wholly unknown.
Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a few experiments, it was
not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of
sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of eighty-seven kinds,
sixty- four germinated after an immersion of twenty-eight days, and
a few survived an immersion of 137 days. It deserves notice that
certain orders were far more injured than others: nine Leguminosae
were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the salt-water
badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceae and
Polemoniaceae, were all killed by a month's immersion. For
convenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules
or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not
have been floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not
they were injured by salt water. Afterwards I tried some larger
fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long time.
It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of
green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods would
often wash into the sea dried plants or branches with seed-capsules
or fruit attached to them. Hence I was led to dry the stems and
branches of ninety-four plants with ripe fruit, and to place them
on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but some which, whilst
green, floated for a very short time, when dried floated much
longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when
dried they floated for ninety days, and afterwards when planted
germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for
twenty-three days, when dried it floated for eighty-five days, and
the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium
sank in two days, when dried they floated for above ninety days,
and afterwards germinated. Altogether, out of the ninety-four dried
plants, eighteen floated for above twenty-eight days; and some of
the eighteen floated for a very much longer period. So that as
64/87 kinds of seeds germinated after an immersion of twenty-eight
days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe fruit (but not all
the same species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after
being dried, for above twenty-eight days, we may conclude, as far
as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts, that the seeds
of 14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated by
sea-currents during twenty-eight days, and would retain their power
of germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of
the several Atlantic currents is thirty-three miles per diem (some
currents running at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this
average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might
be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when
stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favourable spot, would
germinate.</p>
<p>Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones,
but in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in
the actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to
the air like really floating plants. He tried ninety-eight seeds,
mostly different from mine, but he chose many large fruits, and
likewise seeds, from plants which live near the sea; and this would
have favoured both the average length of their flotation and their
resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other
hand, he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the
fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to
have floated much longer. The result was that 18/98 of his seeds of
different kinds floated for forty-two days, and were then capable
of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves
would float for a less time than those protected from violent
movement as in our experiments. Therefore, it would perhaps be
safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora,
after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900
miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger
fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as
plants with large seeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has
shown, generally have restricted ranges, could hardly be
transported by any other means.</p>
<p>Seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift
timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of
the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the
Pacific procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of
drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find that
when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees,
small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their
interstices and behind them, so perfectly that not a particle could
be washed away during the longest transport: out of one small
portion of earth thus COMPLETELY enclosed by the roots of an oak
about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated: I am
certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can show that
the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape
being immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds in the crops of
floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for
instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water;
but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on
artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly all
germinated.</p>
<p>Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in
the transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how
frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances
across the ocean. We may safely assume that under such
circumstances their rate of flight would often be thirty-five miles
an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate. I have
never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the
intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured
through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two
months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds, out of the
excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some of
them, which were tried, germinated. But the following fact is more
important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do
not, as I know by trial, injure in the least the germination of
seeds; now, after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of
food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass
into the gizzard for twelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in this
interval might easily be blown to the distance of five hundred
miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the
contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Some
hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from
twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from
experiments made in the Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable
of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp,
clover, and beet germinated after having been from twelve to
twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey; and
two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days
and fourteen hours. Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many
land and water plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and
thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. I forced
many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave
their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds,
after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in
pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these
seeds retained the power of germination. Certain seeds, however,
were always killed by this process.</p>
<p>Locusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land. I
myself caught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have
heard of others caught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe
informed Sir C. Lyell that in November, 1844, swarms of locusts
visited the island of Madeira. They were in countless numbers, as
thick as the flakes of snow in the heaviest snowstorm, and extended
upward as far as could be seen with a telescope. During two or
three days they slowly careered round and round in an immense
ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at night
alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with
them. They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had
appeared, and have not since visited the island. Now, in parts of
Natal it is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient
evidence, that injurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land
in the dung left by the great flights of locusts which often visit
that country. In consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a
letter a small packet of the dried pellets, out of which I
extracted under the microscope several seeds, and raised from them
seven grass plants, belonging to two species, of two genera. Hence
a swarm of locusts, such as that which visited Madeira, might
readily be the means of introducing several kinds of plants into an
island lying far from the mainland.</p>
<p>Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth
sometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains,
and in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth
from the foot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble
as large as the seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of
a woodcock was sent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry
earth attached to the shank, weighing only nine grains; and this
contained a seed of the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which
germinated and flowered. Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the
last forty years has paid close attention to our migratory birds,
informs me that he has often shot wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears,
and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their first arrival on our shores,
before they had alighted; and he has several times noticed little
cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many facts could be given
showing how generally soil is charged with seeds. For instance,
Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge
(Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a
ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half
ounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken,
watered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two
plants sprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons,
including the common oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of
seventy dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young
leaves, of at least three distinct species. With such facts before
us, can we doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by
gales across great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate—for
instance, the millions of quails across the Mediterranean—must
occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to
their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this subject.</p>
<p>As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and
stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a
land-bird, it can hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as
suggested by Lyell, have transported seeds from one part to another
of the arctic and antarctic regions; and during the Glacial period
from one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the
Azores, from the large number of plants common to Europe, in
comparison with the species on the other islands of the Atlantic,
which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H.C.
Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in comparison with
the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly
stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch. At my request
Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed
erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had
found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not
occur in the archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs
formerly landed their rocky burdens on the shores of these
mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have
brought thither the seeds of northern plants.</p>
<p>Considering that these several means of transport, and that
other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been
in action year after year for tens of thousands of years, it would,
I think, be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become
widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called
accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the
sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of
wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport
would carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain
their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the
action of sea water; nor could they be long carried in the crops or
intestines of birds. These means, however, would suffice for
occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in
breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a
neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another.
The floras of distant continents would not by such means become
mingled; but would remain as distinct as they now are. The
currents, from their course, would never bring seeds from North
America to Britain, though they might and do bring seeds from the
West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed by their
very long immersion in salt water, they could not endure our
climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across
the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores
of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by these
rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt adhering to their
feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident. Even in this
case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on favourable
soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error to
argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has
not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove
this), received within the last few centuries, through occasional
means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent,
that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the
mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. Out of a
hundred kinds of seeds or animals transported to an island, even if
far less well-stocked than Britain, perhaps not more than one would
be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. But
this is no valid argument against what would be effected by
occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological
time, whilst the island was being upheaved, and before it had
become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with
few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every
seed which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would
germinate and survive.</p>
