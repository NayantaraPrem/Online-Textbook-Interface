<h3 class="section_title">1. Classification</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>From the most remote period in the history of the world organic
beings have been found to resemble each other in descending
degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups. This
classification is not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in
constellations. The existence of groups would have been of simple
significance, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit
the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on
vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different, for
it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have
different habits. In the second and fourth chapters, on Variation
and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to show that within each
country it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common,
that is the dominant species, belonging to the larger genera in
each class, which vary most. The varieties, or incipient species,
thus produced, ultimately become converted into new and distinct
species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to
produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups
which are now large, and which generally include many dominant
species, tend to go on increasing in size. I further attempted to
show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to
occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy
of nature, they constantly tend to diverge in character. This
latter conclusion is supported by observing the great diversity of
forms, which, in any small area, come into the closest competition,
and by certain facts in naturalisation.</p>
<p>I attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the
forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to
supplant and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less
improved forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram
illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several
principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is, that the
modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken
up into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on
the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species;
and the whole of the genera along this upper line form together one
class, for all are descended from one ancient parent, and,
consequently, have inherited something in common. But the three
genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in
common, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the
next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common
parent at the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also
much in common, though less than when grouped in subfamilies; and
they form a family distinct from that containing the three genera
still further to the right hand, which diverged at an earlier
period. And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order
distinct from the genera descended from (I). So that we here have
many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into
genera; and the genera into subfamilies, families and orders, all
under one great class. The grand fact of the natural subordination
of organic beings in groups under groups, which, from its
familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my
judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other
objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single
characters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know,
for instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be
thus arranged. In this case there is of course no relation to
genealogical succession, and no cause can at present be assigned
for their falling into groups. But with organic beings the case is
different, and the view above given accords with their natural
arrangement in group under group; and no other explanation has ever
been attempted.</p>
<p>Naturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera
and families in each class, on what is called the Natural System.
But what is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as
a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most
alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an
artificial method of enunciating, as briefly as possible, general
propositions—that is, by one sentence to give the characters
common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to
all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then,
by adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each
kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of this system are
indisputable. But many naturalists think that something more is
meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan
of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or
space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator,
it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge.
Expressions such as that famous one by Linnaeus, which we often
meet with in a more or less concealed form, namely, that the
characters do not make the genus, but that the genus gives the
characters, seem to imply that some deeper bond is included in our
classifications than mere resemblance. I believe that this is the
case, and that community of descent—the one known cause of close
similarity in organic beings—is the bond, which, though observed by
various degrees of modification, is partially revealed to us by our
classifications.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and
the difficulties which are encountered on the view that
classification either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is
simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing
together the forms most like each other. It might have been thought
(and was in ancient times thought) that those parts of the
structure which determined the habits of life, and the general
place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high
importance in classification. Nothing can be more false. No one
regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong
to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These
resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of
the being, are ranked as merely "adaptive or analogical
characters;" but to the consideration of these resemblances we
shall recur. It may even be given as a general rule, that the less
any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits, the
more important it becomes for classification. As an instance: Owen,
in speaking of the dugong, says, "The generative organs, being
those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an
animal, I have always regarded as affording very clear indications
of its true affinities. We are least likely in the modifications of
these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential
character." With plants how remarkable it is that the organs of
vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little
signification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their
product the seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again,
in formerly discussing certain morphological characters which are
not functionally important, we have seen that they are often of the
highest service in classification. This depends on their constancy
throughout many allied groups; and their constancy chiefly depends
on any slight deviations not having been preserved and accumulated
by natural selection, which acts only on serviceable
characters.</p>
<p>That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not
determine its classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact,
that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every
reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its
classificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have
worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has
been fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It
will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who, in
speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceae, says their generic
importance, "like that of all their parts, not only in this, but,
as I apprehend in every natural family, is very unequal, and in
some cases seems to be entirely lost." Again, in another work he
says, the genera of the Connaraceae "differ in having one or more
ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or
valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is
frequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when
all taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis
from Connarus." To give an example among insects: in one great
division of the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has
remarked, are most constant in structure; in another division they
differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate value in
classification; yet no one will say that the antennae in these two
divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological
importance. Any number of instances could be given of the varying
importance for classification of the same important organ within
the same group of beings.</p>
<p>Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are
of high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs
in this condition are often of much value in classification. No one
will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young
ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly
serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and
Pachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the
position of the rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in
the classification of the Grasses.</p>
<p>Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from
parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological
importance, but which are universally admitted as highly
serviceable in the definition of whole groups. For instance,
whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the
mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which absolutely
distinguishes fishes and reptiles—the inflection of the angle of
the lower jaw in Marsupials—the manner in which the wings of
insects are folded—mere colour in certain Algae—mere pubescence on
parts of the flower in grasses—the nature of the dermal covering,
as hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had
been covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and
trifling character would have been considered by naturalists as an
important aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange
creature to birds.</p>
<p>The importance, for classification, of trifling characters,
mainly depends on their being correlated with many other characters
of more or less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of
characters is very evident in natural history. Hence, as has often
been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in several
characters, both of high physiological importance, and of almost
universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it should
be ranked. Hence, also, it has been found that a classification
founded on any single character, however important that may be, has
always failed; for no part of the organisation is invariably
constant. The importance of an aggregate of characters, even when
none are important, alone explains the aphorism enunciated by
Linnaeus, namely, that the characters do not give the genus, but
the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the
appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to
be defined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear
perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has
remarked, "The greater number of the characters proper to the
species, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and
thus laugh at our classification." When Aspicarpa produced in
France, during several years, only these degraded flowers,
departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points
of structure from the proper type of the order, yet M. Richard
sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this genus should still
be retained among the Malpighiaceae. This case well illustrates the
spirit of our classifications.</p>
<p>Practically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble
themselves about the physiological value of the characters which
they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular
species. If they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a
great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one
of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of
subordinate value. This principle has been broadly confessed by
some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than
by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If several trifling
characters are always found in combination, though no apparent bond
of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set
on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as
those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for
propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered
as highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups all
these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer
characters of quite subordinate value. Thus, as Fritz Muller has
lately remarked, in the same group of crustaceans, Cypridina is
furnished with a heart, while in two closely allied genera, namely
Cypris and Cytherea, there is no such organ; one species of
Cypridina has well-developed branchiae, while another species is
destitute of them.</p>
<p>We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of
equal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural
classification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means
obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo
should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult,
which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it
has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards
and Agassiz, that embryological characters are the most important
of all; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.
Nevertheless, their importance has sometimes been exaggerated,
owing to the adaptive characters of larvae not having been
excluded; in order to show this, Fritz Muller arranged, by the aid
of such characters alone, the great class of crustaceans, and the
arrangement did not prove a natural one. But there can be no doubt
that embryonic, excluding larval characters, are of the highest
value for classification, not only with animals but with plants.
Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on
differences in the embryo—on the number and position of the
cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the plumule and
radicle. We shall immediately see why these characters possess so
high a value in classification, namely, from the natural system
being genealogical in its arrangement.</p>
<p>Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of
affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of
characters common to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such
definition has hitherto been found impossible. There are
crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a
character in common; yet the species at both ends, from being
plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can
be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other
class of the Articulata.</p>
<p>Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps
not quite logically, in classification, more especially in very
large groups of closely allied forms. Temminck insists on the
utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of
birds; and it has been followed by several entomologists and
botanists.</p>
<p>Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various
groups of species, such as orders, suborders, families,
subfamilies, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present,
almost arbitrary. Several of the best botanists, such as Mr.
Bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their arbitrary
value. Instances could be given among plants and insects, of a
group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and
then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this has been
done, not because further research has detected important
structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous
allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have
been subsequently discovered.</p>
<p>All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in
classification may be explained, if I do not greatly deceive
myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent
with modification—that the characters which naturalists consider as
showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those
which have been inherited from a common parent, all true
classification being genealogical—that community of descent is the
hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and
not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general
propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects
more or less alike.</p>
<p>But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the
ARRANGEMENT of the groups within each class, in due subordination
and relation to each other, must be strictly genealogical in order
to be natural; but that the AMOUNT of difference in the several
branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to
their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the
different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and
this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera,
families, sections or orders. The reader will best understand what
is meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to the diagram in
the fourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L to represent
allied genera existing during the Silurian epoch, and descended
from some still earlier form. In three of these genera (A, F, and
I) a species has transmitted modified descendants to the present
day, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the
uppermost horizontal line. Now, all these modified descendants from
a single species are related in blood or descent in the same
degree. They may metaphorically be called cousins to the same
millionth degree, yet they differ widely and in different degrees
from each other. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two
or three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended
from I, also broken up into two families. Nor can the existing
species descended from A be ranked in the same genus with the
parent A, or those from I with parent I. But the existing genus F14
may be supposed to have been but slightly modified, and it will
then rank with the parent genus F; just as some few still living
organisms belong to Silurian genera. So that the comparative value
of the differences between these organic beings, which are all
related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be
widely different. Nevertheless, their genealogical ARRANGEMENT
remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but at each
successive period of descent. All the modified descendants from A
will have inherited something in common from their common parent,
as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with each
subordinate branch of descendants at each successive stage. If,
however, we suppose any descendant of A or of I to have become so
much modified as to have lost all traces of its parentage in this
case, its place in the natural system will be lost, as seems to
have occurred with some few existing organisms. All the descendants
of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are supposed to
have been but little modified, and they form a single genus. But
this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper
intermediate position. The representation of the groups as here
given in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The
branches ought to have diverged in all directions. If the names of
the groups had been simply written down in a linear series the
representation would have been still less natural; and it is
notoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat
surface, the affinities which we discover in nature among the
beings of the same group. Thus, the natural system is genealogical
in its arrangement, like a pedigree. But the amount of modification
which the different groups have undergone has to be expressed by
ranking them under different so-called genera, subfamilies,
families, sections, orders, and classes.</p>
<p>It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification,
by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree
of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would
afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken
throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all
intermediate and slowly changing dialects, were to be included,
such an arrangement would be the only possible one. Yet it might be
that some ancient languages had altered very little and had given
rise to few new languages, whilst others had altered much owing to
the spreading, isolation and state of civilisation of the several
co-descended races, and had thus given rise to many new dialects
and languages. The various degrees of difference between the
languages of the same stock would have to be expressed by groups
subordinate to groups; but the proper or even the only possible
arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly
natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and
recent, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and
origin of each tongue.</p>
<p>In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the
classification of varieties, which are known or believed to be
descended from a single species. These are grouped under the
species, with the subvarieties under the varieties; and in some
cases, as with the domestic pigeon, with several other grades of
difference. Nearly the same rules are followed as in classifying
species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of arranging
varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are
cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the
pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most
important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the
Swedish and common turnip together, though the esculent and
thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most
constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great
agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this
purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape
or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep the horns are much
less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I
apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical
classification would be universally preferred; and it has been
attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had
been more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance
would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest
number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the
subvarieties differ in the important character of the length of the
beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of
tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this
habit; nevertheless, without any thought on the subject, these
tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and
alike in some other respects.</p>
<p>With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact
brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his
lowest grade, that of species, the two sexes; and how enormously
these sometimes differ in the most important characters is known to
every naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in
common of the adult males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes,
and yet no one dreams of separating them. As soon as the three
Orchidean forms, Monachanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum, which had
previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be
sometimes produced on the same plant, they were immediately
considered as varieties; and now I have been able to show that they
are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the same species.
The naturalist includes as one species the various larval stages of
the same individual, however much they may differ from each other
and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate generations
of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as
the same individual. He includes monsters and varieties, not from
their partial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they are
descended from it.</p>
<p>As descent has universally been used in classing together the
individuals of the same species, though the males and females and
larvae are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used
in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes
a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of
descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under
genera, and genera under higher groups, all under the so-called
natural system? I believe it has been unconsciously used; and thus
only can I understand the several rules and guides which have been
followed by our best systematists. As we have no written pedigrees,
we are forced to trace community of descent by resemblances of any
kind. Therefore, we choose those characters which are the least
likely to have been modified, in relation to the conditions of life
to which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary
structures on this view are as good as, or even sometimes better
than other parts of the organisation. We care not how trifling a
character may be—let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the
jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the
skin be covered by hair or feathers—if it prevail throughout many
and different species, especially those having very different
habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its
presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by
inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in
regard to single points of structure, but when several characters,
let them be ever so trifling, concur throughout a large group of
beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the
theory of descent, that these characters have been inherited from a
common ancestor; and we know that such aggregated characters have
especial value in classification.</p>
<p>We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart
from its allies, in several of its most important characteristics,
and yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and
is often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let
them be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community
of descent. Let two forms have not a single character in common,
yet, if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of
intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of
descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find organs
of high physiological importance—those which serve to preserve life
under the most diverse conditions of existence—are generally the
most constant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same
organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ
much, we at once value them less in our classification. We shall
presently see why embryological characters are of such high
classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may sometimes
be brought usefully into play in classing large genera, because all
the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated
region, are in all probability descended from the same parents.</p>
