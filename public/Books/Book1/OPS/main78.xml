<p>First crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked
as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not
universally, sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often
so slight that the most careful experimentalists have arrived at
diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test.
The sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same
species, and is eminently susceptible to action of favourable and
unfavourable conditions. The degree of sterility does not strictly
follow systematic affinity, but is governed by several curious and
complex laws. It is generally different, and sometimes widely
different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. It is
not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrids
produced from this cross.</p>
<p>In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one
species or variety to take on another, is incidental on
differences, generally of an unknown nature, in their vegetative
systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility of one
species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences
in their reproductive systems. There is no more reason to think
that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of
sterility to prevent their crossing and blending in nature, than to
think that trees have been specially endowed with various and
somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together
in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.</p>
<p>The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has
not been acquired through natural selection. In the case of first
crosses it seems to depend on several circumstances; in some
instances in chief part on the early death of the embryo. In the
case of hybrids, it apparently depends on their whole organisation
having been disturbed by being compounded from two distinct forms;
the sterility being closely allied to that which so frequently
affects pure species, when exposed to new and unnatural conditions
of life. He who will explain these latter cases will be able to
explain the sterility of hybrids. This view is strongly supported
by a parallelism of another kind: namely, that, firstly, slight
changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour and fertility
of all organic beings; and secondly, that the crossing of forms,
which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life,
or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of
their offspring. The facts given on the sterility of the
illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their
illegitimate progeny, perhaps render it probable that some unknown
bond in all cases connects the degree of fertility of first unions
with that of their offspring. The consideration of these facts on
dimorphism, as well as of the results of reciprocal crosses,
clearly leads to the conclusion that the primary cause of the
sterility of crossed species is confined to differences in their
sexual elements. But why, in the case of distinct species, the
sexual elements should so generally have become more or less
modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but
it seems to stand in some close relation to species having been
exposed for long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of
life.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two
species, and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in
most cases correspond, even if due to distinct causes: for both
depend on the amount of difference between the species which are
crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a
first cross, and the fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and
the capacity of being grafted together—though this latter capacity
evidently depends on widely different circumstances—should all run,
to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the
forms subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity includes
resemblances of all kinds.</p>
<p>First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or
sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel
offspring, are very generally, but not, as is so often stated,
invariably fertile. Nor is this almost universal and perfect
fertility surprising, when it is remembered how liable we are to
argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature;
and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been
produced under domestication by the selection of mere external
differences, and that they have not been long exposed to uniform
conditions of life. It should also be especially kept in mind, that
long-continued domestication tends to eliminate sterility, and is
therefore little likely to induce this same quality. Independently
of the question of fertility, in all other respects there is the
closest general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels, in their
variability, in their power of absorbing each other by repeated
crosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both
parent-forms. Finally, then, although we are as ignorant of the
precise cause of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids as
we are why animals and plants removed from their natural conditions
become sterile, yet the facts given in this chapter do not seem to
me opposed to the belief that species aboriginally existed as
varieties.</p>
