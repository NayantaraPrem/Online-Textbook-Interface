<h3 class="section_title">7. Organs Of Little Apparent Importance,
As Affected By Natural Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of
the fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted
individuals, I have sometimes felt great difficulty in
understanding the origin or formation of parts of little
importance; almost as great, though of a very different kind, as in
the case of the most perfect and complex organs.</p>
<p>In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the
whole economy of any one organic being to say what slight
modifications would be of importance or not. In a former chapter I
have given instances of very trifling characters, such as the down
on fruit and the colour of its flesh, the colour of the skin and
hair of quadrupeds, which, from being correlated with
constitutional differences, or from determining the attacks of
insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural selection. The tail
of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper;
and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted
for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each
better and better fitted, for so trifling an object as to drive
away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even in
this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of
cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on
their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that
individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these
small enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus
gain a great advantage. It is not that the larger quadrupeds are
actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by flies, but they
are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced, so that they
are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a coming
dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.</p>
<p>Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases
been of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having
been slowly perfected at a former period, have been transmitted to
existing species in nearly the same state, although now of very
slight use; but any actually injurious deviations in their
structure would of course have been checked by natural selection.
Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most
aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in
so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified
swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus
accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an
aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all
sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as
an aid in turning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in
this latter respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any
tail, can double still more quickly.</p>
<p>In the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance
to characters, and in believing that they have been developed
through natural selection. We must by no means overlook the effects
of the definite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called
spontaneous variations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate
degree on the nature of the conditions, of the tendency to
reversion to long-lost characters, of the complex laws of growth,
such as of correlation, comprehension, of the pressure of one part
on another, etc., and finally of sexual selection, by which
characters of use to one sex are often gained and then transmitted
more or less perfectly to the other sex, though of no use to the
sex. But structures thus indirectly gained, although at first of no
advantage to a species, may subsequently have been taken advantage
of by its modified descendants, under new conditions of life and
newly acquired habits.</p>
<p>If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that
there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should
have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to
conceal this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and
consequently that it was a character of importance, and had been
acquired through natural selection; as it is, the colour is
probably in chief part due to sexual selection. A trailing palm in
the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of
exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the
branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service
to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees
which are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe
from the distribution of the thorn- bearing species in Africa and
South America, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so
the spikes on the palm may at first have been developed for this
object, and subsequently have been improved and taken advantage of
by the plant, as it underwent further modification and became a
climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally
considered as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and
so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of
putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing any such
inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the
clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the
skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful
adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or
may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the
skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from
a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the
laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition
of the higher animals.</p>
<p>We are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation
or individual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of
this by reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our
domesticated animals in different countries, more especially in the
less civilized countries, where there has been but little
methodical selection. Animals kept by savages in different
countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence, and are
exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and individuals
with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under
different climates. With cattle susceptibility to the attacks of
flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned
by certain plants; so that even colour would be thus subjected to
the action of natural selection. Some observers are convinced that
a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the
hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from
lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the
hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of
the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the front
limbs and the head would probably be affected. The shape, also, of
the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of certain parts of
the young in the womb. The laborious breathing necessary in high
regions tends, as we have good reason to believe, to increase the
size of the chest; and again correlation would come into play. The
effects of lessened exercise, together with abundant food, on the
whole organisation is probably still more important, and this, as
H. von Nathusius has lately shown in his excellent Treatise, is
apparently one chief cause of the great modification which the
breeds of swine have undergone. But we are far too ignorant to
speculate on the relative importance of the several known and
unknown causes of variation; and I have made these remarks only to
show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic
differences of our several domestic breeds, which nevertheless are
generally admitted to have arisen through ordinary generation from
one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too much stress on
our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous
differences between true species.</p>
