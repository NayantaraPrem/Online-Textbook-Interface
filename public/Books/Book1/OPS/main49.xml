<p>Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one
case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this
or that part has varied. But whenever we have the means of
instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in
producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same
species, and the greater differences between species of the same
genus. Changed conditions generally induce mere fluctuating
variability, but sometimes they cause direct and definite effects;
and these may become strongly marked in the course of time, though
we have not sufficient evidence on this head. Habit in producing
constitutional peculiarities, and use in strengthening, and disuse
in weakening and diminishing organs, appear in many cases to have
been potent in their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the
same manner, and homologous parts tend to cohere. Modifications in
hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and
internal parts. When one part is largely developed, perhaps it
tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part
of the structure which can be saved without detriment will be
saved. Changes of structure at an early age may affect parts
subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated variation, the
nature of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly occur.
Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps
arising from such parts not having been closely specialised for any
particular function, so that their modifications have not been
closely checked by natural selection. It follows probably from this
same cause, that organic beings low in the scale are more variable
than those standing higher in the scale, and which have their whole
organisation more specialised. Rudimentary organs, from being
useless, are not regulated by natural selection, and hence are
variable. Specific characters—that is, the characters which have
come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched
off from a common parent—are more variable than generic characters,
or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed
within this same period. In these remarks we have referred to
special parts or organs being still variable, because they have
recently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in
the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole
individual; for in a district where many species of a genus are
found—that is, where there has been much former variation and
differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has
been actively at work—in that district and among these species, we
now find, on an average, most varieties. Secondary sexual
characters are highly variable, and such characters differ much in
the species of the same group. Variability in the same parts of the
organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving
secondary sexual differences to the two sexes of the same species,
and specific differences to the several species of the same genus.
Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an
extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in
the allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount
of modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand
why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than
other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process,
and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time
to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to
a less modified state. But when a species with an extraordinarily
developed organ has become the parent of many modified
descendants—which on our view must be a very slow process,
requiring a long lapse of time—in this case, natural selection has
succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however
extraordinary a manner it may have been developed. Species
inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent, and
exposed to similar influences, naturally tend to present analogous
variations, or these same species may occasionally revert to some
of the characters of their ancient progenitors. Although new and
important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous
variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and
harmonious diversity of nature.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the
offspring and their parents—and a cause for each must exist—we have
reason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of beneficial
differences which has given rise to all the more important
modifications of structure in relation to the habits of each
species.</p>
