<h3 class="section_title">9. Summary: The Law Of Unity Of Type And
Of The Conditions Of Existence Embraced By The Theory Of Natural
Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and
objections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are
serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown
on several facts, which on the belief of independent acts of
creation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one
period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together
by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the
process of natural selection is always very slow, and at any one
time acts only on a few forms; and partly because the very process
of natural selection implies the continual supplanting and
extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. Closely allied
species, now living on a continuous area, must often have been
formed when the area was not continuous, and when the conditions of
life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another.
When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous
area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an
intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate
variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms
which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course
of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will
have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety,
and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating
it.</p>
<p>We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in
concluding that the most different habits of life could not
graduate into each other; that a bat, for instance, could not have
been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first only
glided through the air.</p>
<p>We have seen that a species under new conditions of life may
change its habits, or it may have diversified habits, with some
very unlike those of its nearest congeners. Hence we can
understand, bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to
live wherever it can live, how it has arisen that there are upland
geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and
petrels with the habits of auks.</p>
<p>Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could
have been formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any
one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of
gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor, then under
changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in
the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through
natural selection. In the cases in which we know of no intermediate
or transitional states, we should be extremely cautious in
concluding that none can have existed, for the metamorphoses of
many organs show what wonderful changes in function are at least
possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been
converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having
performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having
been in part or in whole specialised for one function; and two
distinct organs having performed at the same time the same
function, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other,
must often have largely facilitated transitions.</p>
<p>We have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in
the natural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in
external appearance closely similar may have been separately and
independently formed; but when such organs are closely examined,
essential differences in their structure can almost always be
detected; and this naturally follows from the principle of natural
selection. On the other hand, the common rule throughout nature is
infinite diversity of structure for gaining the same end; and this
again naturally follows from the same great principle.</p>
<p>In many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert
that a part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a
species, that modifications in its structure could not have been
slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. In many other
cases, modifications are probably the direct result of the laws of
variation or of growth, independently of any good having been thus
gained. But even such structures have often, as we may feel
assured, been subsequently taken advantage of, and still further
modified, for the good of species under new conditions of life. We
may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has
frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its
terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small
importance that it could not, in its present state, have been
acquired by means of natural selection.</p>
<p>Natural selection can produce nothing in one species for the
exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce
parts, organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable,
or highly injurious to another species, but in all cases at the
same time useful to the possessor. In each well-stocked country
natural selection acts through the competition of the inhabitants
and consequently leads to success in the battle for life, only in
accordance with the standard of that particular country. Hence the
inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, often yield
to the inhabitants of another and generally the larger country. For
in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and
more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer,
and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.
Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute perfection;
nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute
perfection be everywhere predicated.</p>
<p>On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the
full meaning of that old canon in natural history, "Natura non
facit saltum." This canon, if we look to the present inhabitants
alone of the world, is not strictly correct; but if we include all
those of past times, whether known or unknown, it must on this
theory be strictly true.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been
formed on two great lawsâ€”Unity of Type, and the Conditions of
Existence. By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in
structure which we see in organic beings of the same class, and
which is quite independent of their habits of life. On my theory,
unity of type is explained by unity of descent. The expression of
conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious
Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection.
For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts
of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or
by having adapted them during past periods of time: the adaptations
being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse of parts,
being affected by the direct action of external conditions of life,
and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and
variation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence
is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of
former variations and adaptations, that of Unity of Type.</p>
