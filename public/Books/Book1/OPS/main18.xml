<p>Finally, varieties cannot be distinguished from speciesâ€”except,
first, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and,
secondly, by a certain indefinite amount of difference between
them; for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked
as varieties, notwithstanding that they cannot be closely
connected; but the amount of difference considered necessary to
give to any two forms the rank of species cannot be defined. In
genera having more than the average number of species in any
country, the species of these genera have more than the average
number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to be
closely but unequally allied together, forming little clusters
round other species. Species very closely allied to other species
apparently have restricted ranges. In all these respects the
species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties.
And we can clearly understand these analogies, if species once
existed as varieties, and thus originated; whereas, these analogies
are utterly inexplicable if species are independent creations.</p>
<p>We have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant
species of the larger genera within each class which on an average
yield the greatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall
hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct
species. Thus the larger genera tend to become larger; and
throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to
become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant
descendants. But, by steps hereafter to be explained, the larger
genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. And thus, the
forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups
subordinate to groups.</p>
