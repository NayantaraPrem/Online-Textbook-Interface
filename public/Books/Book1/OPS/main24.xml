<h3 class="section_title">5. Complex Relations Of All Animals And
Plants To Each Other In The Struggle For Existence</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are
the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to
struggle together in the same country. I will give only a single
instance, which, though a simple one, interested me. In
Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation, where I had ample means
of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath,
which had never been touched by the hand of man; but several
hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed
twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The
change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath
was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from
one quite different soil to another: not only the proportional
numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species
of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the
plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The effect on
the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous
birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be
seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or three
distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been the
effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else
having been done, with the exception of the land having been
enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an
element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here
there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on
the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have
been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in
multitudes, so close together that all cannot live. When I
ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted I
was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several
points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the
unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch
fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between
the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little
trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In
one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of
the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them,
with twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to
raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No
wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly
clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so
extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have
imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched
it for food.</p>
<p>Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of
the Scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine
the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious
instance of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have
ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral
state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the
greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in
the navels of these animals when first born. The increase of these
flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some
means, probably by other parasitic insects. Hence, if certain
insectivorous birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic
insects would probably increase; and this would lessen the number
of the navel-frequenting flies—then cattle and horses would become
feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have
observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again
would largely affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen in
Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in
ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that under nature the
relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must
be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in the
long-run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature
remains for long periods of time uniform, though assuredly the
merest trifle would give the victory to one organic being over
another. Nevertheless, so profound is our ignorance, and so high
our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of
an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke
cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of
the forms of life!</p>
<p>I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and
animals, remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web
of complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that
the exotic Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by
insects, and consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets
a seed. Nearly all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the
visits of insects to remove their pollen-masses and thus to
fertilise them. I find from experiments that humble-bees are almost
indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola
tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. I have also
found that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilisation
of some kinds of clover; for instance twenty heads of Dutch clover
(Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds, but twenty other heads,
protected from bees, produced not one. Again, 100 heads of red
clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the same number of
protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble bees alone visit
red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It has been
suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt whether
they could do so in the case of the red clover, from their weight
not being sufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may infer
as highly probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees became
extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover
would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of
humble-bees in any district depends in a great measure upon the
number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and
Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees,
believes that "more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all
over England." Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as
every one knows, on the number of cats; and Colonel Newman says,
"Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of
humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the
number of cats that destroy the mice." Hence it is quite credible
that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district
might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of
bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!</p>
<p>In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at
different periods of life, and during different seasons or years,
probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally
the most potent, but all will concur in determining the average
number, or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can
be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in
different districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing
an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional
numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view is
this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down,
a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed
that ancient Indian ruins in the Southern United States, which must
formerly have been cleared of trees, now display the same beautiful
diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin
forests. What a struggle must have gone on during long centuries
between the several kinds of trees, each annually scattering its
seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect—between
insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of
prey—all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the
trees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which
first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees.
Throw up a handful of feathers, and all fall to the ground
according to definite laws; but how simple is the problem where
each shall fall compared to that of the action and reaction of the
innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course
of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now
growing on the old Indian ruins!</p>
<p>The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite
on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of
nature. This is likewise sometimes the case with those which may
strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence, as in
the case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle
will almost invariably be most severe between the individuals of
the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the
same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of
varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be
almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon
decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown
together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which
best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile,
will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently
in a few years supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed
stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously
coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately,
and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker
kinds will steadily decrease in number and disappear. So again with
the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain
mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so
that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed
from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech.
It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any of our domestic
plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and
constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock
(crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen
generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same
manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young
were not annually preserved in due proportion.</p>
