<h3 class="section_title">4. Correlated Variation</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied
together, during its growth and development, that when slight
variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through
natural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very
important subject, most imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly
different classes of facts may be here easily confounded together.
We shall presently see that simple inheritance often gives the
false appearance of correlation. One of the most obvious real cases
is, that variations of structure arising in the young or larvae
naturally tend to affect the structure of the mature animal. The
several parts which are homologous, and which, at an early
embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are
necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to
vary in a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of
the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs,
and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw
is believed by some anatomists to be homologous with the limbs.
These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less
completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once
existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of
any great use to the breed, it might probably have been rendered
permanent by natural selection.</p>
<p>Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to
cohere; this is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more
common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as
in the union of the petals into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect
the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors
that with birds the diversity in the shape of the pelvis causes the
remarkable diversity in the shape of the kidneys. Others believe
that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by
pressure the shape of the head of the child. In snakes, according
to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing
determine the position and form of several of the most important
viscera.</p>
<p>The nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure. M. Is.
Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain
malconformations frequently, and that others rarely, coexist
without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more
singular than the relation in cats between complete whiteness and
blue eyes with deafness, or between the tortoise-shell colour and
the female sex; or in pigeons, between their feathered feet and
skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence of more or
less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the future
colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and
the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology
comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I
think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals
which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea
(whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), are
likewise on the whole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there
are so many exceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked,
that it has little value.</p>
<p>I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the
laws of correlation and variation, independently of utility, and
therefore of natural selection, than that of the difference between
the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous
plants. Everyone is familiar with the difference between the ray
and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this
difference is often accompanied with the partial or complete
abortion of the reproductive organs. But in some of these plants
the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture. These differences
have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the involucra on
the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of the
seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositae countenances this idea;
but with the Umbelliferae it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs
me, the species with the densest heads which most frequently differ
in their inner and outer flowers. It might have been thought that
the development of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the
reproductive organs causes their abortion; but this can hardly be
the sole case, for in some Compositae the seeds of the outer and
inner florets differ, without any difference in the corolla.
Possibly these several differences may be connected with the
different flow of nutriment towards the central and external
flowers. We know, at least, that with irregular flowers those
nearest to the axis are most subject to peloria, that is to become
abnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an instance of this fact, and
as a striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the
two upper petals in the central flower of the truss often lose
their patches of darker colour; and when this occurs, the adherent
nectary is quite aborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric
or regular. When the colour is absent from only one of the two
upper petals, the nectary is not quite aborted but is much
shortened.</p>
<p>With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea
that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is
highly advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these
plants, is highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have
come into play. But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible
that their differences in shape, which are not always correlated
with any difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial;
yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent
importance—the seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior
flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers—that the elder De
Candolle founded his main divisions in the order on such
characters. Hence modifications of structure, viewed by
systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to the laws of
variation and correlation, without being, as far as we can judge,
of the slightest service to the species.</p>
<p>We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation
structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which
in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor
may have acquired through natural selection some one modification
in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and
independent modification; and these two modifications, having been
transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits,
would naturally be thought to be in some necessary manner
correlated. Some other correlations are apparently due to the
manner in which natural selection can alone act. For instance,
Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in
fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by the
impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural
selection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone
could the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by
the wind, gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide
dispersal.</p>
