<h3 class="section_title">4. Nature Of The Checks To Increase</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The causes which check the natural tendency of each species to
increase are most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as
much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase
still further. We know not exactly what the checks are even in a
single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how
ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, although
so incomparably better known than any other animal. This subject of
the checks to increase has been ably treated by several authors,
and I hope in a future work to discuss it at considerable length,
more especially in regard to the feral animals of South America.
Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader's
mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals seem
generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With
plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some
observations which I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer
most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other
plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various
enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two
wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from
other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as
they came up, and out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed,
chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and
the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds,
be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less
vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of twenty species
grown on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four) nine
species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up
freely.</p>
<p>The amount of food for each species, of course, gives the
extreme limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is
not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals,
which determines the average number of a species. Thus, there seems
to be little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares
on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin.
If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in
England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there
would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although
hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually shot. On the
other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant, none are destroyed
by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most rarely dares to
attack a young elephant protected by its dam.</p>
<p>Climate plays an important part in determining the average
numbers of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or
drought seem to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated
(chiefly from the greatly reduced numbers of nests in the spring)
that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my
own grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember
that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from
epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to
be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far
as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most
severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of
distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when
climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the
least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food
through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we
travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we
invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and
finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous,
we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action.
But this is a false view; we forget that each species, even where
it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at
some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the
same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the
least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will
increase in numbers; and as each area is already fully stocked with
inhabitants, the other species must decrease. When we travel
southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure
that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured,
as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but
in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all
kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward; hence in
going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet
with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of
climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a
mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits,
or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively
with the elements.</p>
<p>That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other
species we clearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in
our gardens can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never
become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants
nor resist destruction by our native animals.</p>
<p>When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances,
increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics—at
least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals—often
ensue; and here we have a limiting check independent of the
struggle for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics
appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause,
possibly in part through facility of diffusion among the crowded
animals, been disproportionally favoured: and here comes in a sort
of struggle between the parasite and its prey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals
of the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is
absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise
plenty of corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the
seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which
feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of
food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the
supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during the winter; but
any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from
a few wheat or other such plants in a garden; I have in this case
lost every single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock
of the same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some
singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being
sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where they do exist;
and that of some social plants being social, that is abounding in
individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range. For in such
cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the
conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist
together, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I
should add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill
effects of close interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of
these cases; but I will not here enlarge on this subject.</p>
