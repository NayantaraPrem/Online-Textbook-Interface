<h3 class="section_title">1. Fresh-Water Productions</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by
barriers of land, it might have been thought that fresh-water
productions would not have ranged widely within the same country,
and as the sea is apparently a still more formidable barrier, that
they would never have extended to distant countries. But the case
is exactly the reverse. Not only have many fresh-water species,
belonging to different classes, an enormous range, but allied
species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. When
first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I well remember
feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects,
shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding
terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.</p>
<p>But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I
think, in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in
a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations
from pond to pond, or from stream to stream, within their own
countries; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this
capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider
only a few cases; of these, some of the most difficult to explain
are presented by fish. It was formerly believed that the same
fresh-water species never existed on two continents distant from
each other. But Dr. Gunther has lately shown that the Galaxias
attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands and
the mainland of South America. This is a wonderful case, and
probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during a
former warm period. This case, however, is rendered in some degree
less surprising by the species of this genus having the power of
crossing by some unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean:
thus there is one species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland
Islands, though separated by a distance of about 230 miles. On the
same continent fresh-water fish often range widely, and as if
capriciously; for in two adjoining river systems some of the
species may be the same and some wholly different.</p>
<p>It is probable that they are occasionally transported by what
may be called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not
very rarely dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is
known that the ova retain their vitality for a considerable time
after removal from the water. Their dispersal may, however, be
mainly attributed to changes in the level of the land within the
recent period, causing rivers to flow into each other. Instances,
also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without
any change of level. The wide differences of the fish on the
opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous and
consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented
the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to
the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient
forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great
geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much
migration. Moreover, Dr. Gunther has recently been led by several
considerations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long
endurance. Salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to
live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is
hardly a single group of which all the members are confined to
fresh water, so that a marine species belonging to a fresh-water
group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and could, it
is probable, become adapted without much difficulty to the fresh
waters of a distant land.</p>
<p>Some species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and
allied species which, on our theory, are descended from a common
parent, and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail
throughout the world. Their distribution at first perplexed me
much, as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds; and
the ova, as well as the adults, are immediately killed by
sea-water. I could not even understand how some naturalised species
have spread rapidly throughout the same country. But two facts,
which I have observed—and many others no doubt will be
discovered—throw some light on this subject. When ducks suddenly
emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these
little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me,
in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I
have unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from
the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I
suspended the feet of a duck in an aquarium, where many ova of
fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the
extremely minute and just-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and
clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could
not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they
would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched molluscs, though
aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet, in damp air,
from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or
heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and if blown
across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant point,
would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir Charles Lyell
informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a
fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a
water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board
the "Beagle," when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land:
how much farther it might have been blown by a favouring gale no
one can tell.</p>
<p>With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous
ranges many fresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over
continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. This is
strikingly illustrated, according to Alph. de Candolle, in those
large groups of terrestrial plants, which have very few aquatic
members; for the latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in
consequence, a wide range. I think favourable means of dispersal
explain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth occasionally
adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading
birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly
flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds of this
order wander more than those of any other; and are occasionally
found on the most remote and barren islands of the open ocean; they
would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that
any dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining
the land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water
haunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the
mud of ponds is with seeds: I have tried several little
experiments, but will here give only the most striking case: I took
in February three tablespoonfuls of mud from three different
points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this mud when
dry weighed only 6 and 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered up in my study
for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the
plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and
yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup!
Considering these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable
circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of
fresh-water plants to unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very
distant points. The same agency may have come into play with the
eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water animals.</p>
<p>Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I
have stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though
they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even
small fish swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow
water-lily and Potamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after
century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they then take flight
and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and we have
seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected
many hours afterwards in pellets or in the excrement. When I saw
the great size of the seeds of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium,
and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks on the distribution of
this plant, I thought that the means of its dispersal must remain
inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the
great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr. Hooker, the
Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach. Now this bird must often
have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds,
and, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe
that it would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state
for germination.</p>
<p>In considering these several means of distribution, it should be
remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance
on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg
will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always
be a struggle for life between the inhabitants of the same pond,
however few in kind, yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond
is small in comparison with the number of species inhabiting an
equal area of land, the competition between them will probably be
less severe than between terrestrial species; consequently an
intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better
chance of seizing on a new place, than in the case of terrestrial
colonists. We should also remember that many fresh-water
productions are low in the scale of nature, and we have reason to
believe that such beings become modified more slowly than the high;
and this will give time for the migration of aquatic species. We
should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms having
formerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having
become extinct at intermediate points. But the wide distribution of
fresh-water plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the
same identical form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends
in main part on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by
animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have great
powers of flight, and naturally travel from one piece of water to
another.</p>
