<h3 class="section_title">3. On The Forms Of Life Changing Almost
Simultaneously Throughout The World</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than
the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously
throughout the world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be
recognised in many distant regions, under the most different
climates, where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be
found; namely, in North America, in equatorial South America, in
Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of
India. For at these distant points, the organic remains in certain
beds present an unmistakable resemblance to those of the Chalk. It
is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not
one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same
families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are
similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial
sculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are not found in the Chalk
of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below,
occur in the same order at these distant points of the world. In
the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western
Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of
life has been observed by several authors; so it is, according to
Lyell, with the European and North American tertiary deposits. Even
if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New
Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the
successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic and tertiary stages,
would still be manifest, and the several formations could be easily
correlated.</p>
<p>These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of
the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the
productions of the land and of fresh water at distant points change
in the same parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus
changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had
been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any information in
regard to their geological position, no one would have suspected
that they had co-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as
these anomalous monsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it
might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of
the later tertiary stages.</p>
<p>When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed
simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that
this expression relates to the same year, or even to the same
century, or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if
all the marine animals now living in Europe, and all those that
lived in Europe during the pleistocene period (a very remote period
as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch) were
compared with those now existing in South America or in Australia,
the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the
present or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most
closely those of the southern hemisphere. So, again, several highly
competent observers maintain that the existing productions of the
United States are more closely related to those which lived in
Europe during certain late tertiary stages, than to the present
inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is evident that
fossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North America
would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older
European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch,
there can be little doubt that all the more modern MARINE
formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and
strictly modern beds of Europe, North and South America, and
Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied,
and from not including those forms which are found only in the
older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as
simultaneous in a geological sense.</p>
<p>The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the
above large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly
struck those admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac.
After referring to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life
in various parts of Europe, they add, "If struck by this strange
sequence, we turn our attention to North America, and there
discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain
that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the
introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine
currents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but
depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom." M.
Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It
is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate,
or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great mutations
in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most different
climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some special
law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present
distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation
between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature
of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life
throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural
selection. New species are formed by having some advantage over
older forms; and the forms, which are already dominant, or have
some advantage over the other forms in their own country, give
birth to the greatest number of new varieties or incipient species.
We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are
dominant, that is, which are commonest and most widely diffused,
producing the greatest number of new varieties. It is also natural
that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species, which have
already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of other
species, should be those which would have the best chance of
spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to
other new varieties and species. The process of diffusion would
often be very slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes,
on strange accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new
species to the various climates through which they might have to
pass, but in the course of time the dominant forms would generally
succeed in spreading and would ultimately prevail. The diffusion
would, it is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants
of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the
continuous sea. We might therefore expect to find, as we do find, a
less strict degree of parallelism in the succession of the
productions of the land than with those of the sea.</p>
<p>Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large
sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life
throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new
species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and
varying; the new species thus produced being themselves dominant,
owing to their having had some advantage over their already
dominant parents, as well as over other species; and again
spreading, varying, and producing new forms. The old forms which
are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious
forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some
inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and improved groups
spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world;
and the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in
their first appearance and final disappearance.</p>
<p>There is one other remark connected with this subject worth
making. I have given my reasons for believing that most of our
great formations, rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of
subsidence; and that blank intervals of vast duration, as far as
fossils are concerned, occurred during the periods when the bed of
the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment
was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic
remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the
inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of
modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from
other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that large
areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that
strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated
over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are
very far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably
been the case, and that large areas have invariably been affected
by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited in
two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period, we
should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing
paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but
the species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been
a little more time in the one region than in the other for
modification, extinction, and immigration.</p>
<p>I suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr.
Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of
England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism
between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he
compares certain stages in England with those in France, although
he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species
belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in
a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of
the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus
separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous
faunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later
tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking
general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia
and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of
difference in the species. If the several formations in these
regions have not been deposited during the same exact periods—a
formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval
in the other—and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly
changing during the accumulation of the several formations and
during the long intervals of time between them; in this case the
several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same
order, in accordance with the general succession of the forms of
life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel;
nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the
apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.</p>
