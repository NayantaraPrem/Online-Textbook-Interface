<p>In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face
of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that
neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of
various regions can be wholly accounted for by climatal and other
physical conditions. Of late, almost every author who has studied
the subject has come to this conclusion. The case of America alone
would almost suffice to prove its truth; for if we exclude the
arctic and northern temperate parts, all authors agree that one of
the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that
between the New and Old Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast
American continent, from the central parts of the United States to
its extreme southern point, we meet with the most diversified
conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy
plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers, under almost
every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the
Old World which cannot be paralleled in the New—at least so closely
as the same species generally require. No doubt small areas can be
pointed out in the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but
these are not inhabited by a fauna different from that of the
surrounding districts; for it is rare to find a group of organisms
confined to a small area, of which the conditions are peculiar in
only a slight degree. Notwithstanding this general parallelism in
the conditions of Old and New Worlds, how widely different are
their living productions!</p>
<p>In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land
in Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between
latitudes 25 and 35 degrees, we shall find parts extremely similar
in all their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out
three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may
compare the productions of South America south of latitude 35
degrees with those north of 25 degrees, which consequently are
separated by a space of ten degrees of latitude, and are exposed to
considerably different conditions; yet they are incomparably more
closely related to each other than they are to the productions of
Australia or Africa under nearly the same climate. Analogous facts
could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.</p>
<p>A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is,
that barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are
related in a close and important manner to the differences between
the productions of various regions. We see this in the great
difference in nearly all the terrestrial productions of the New and
Old Worlds, excepting in the northern parts, where the land almost
joins, and where, under a slightly different climate, there might
have been free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there
now is for the strictly arctic productions. We see the same fact in
the great difference between the inhabitants of Australia, Africa,
and South America under the same latitude; for these countries are
almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On each
continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of
lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts and even
of large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain
chains, deserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have
endured so long, as the oceans separating continents, the
differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of
distinct continents.</p>
<p>Turning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants
of the eastern and western shores of South America are very
distinct, with extremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in
common; but Dr. Gunther has recently shown that about thirty per
cent of the fishes are the same on the opposite sides of the
isthmus of Panama; and this fact has led naturalists to believe
that the isthmus was formerly open. Westward of the shores of
America, a wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as
a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another
kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands
of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna. So that
three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel lines
not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from
being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of
land or open sea, they are almost wholly distinct. On the other
hand, proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of
the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable
barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places, or
continuous coasts, until, after travelling over a hemisphere, we
come to the shores of Africa; and over this vast space we meet with
no well-defined and distinct marine faunas. Although so few marine
animals are common to the above-named three approximate faunas of
Eastern and Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, yet
many fishes range from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many
shells are common to the eastern islands of the Pacific and the
eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposite meridians of
longitude.</p>
<p>A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement,
is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the
same sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different
points and stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and
every continent offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the
naturalist, in travelling, for instance, from north to south, never
fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of
beings, specifically distinct, though nearly related, replace each
other. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds,
notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed,
but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner.
The plains near the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one
species of Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the plains of La
Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true
ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and Australia under
the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we see the
agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our
hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but
they plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the
lofty peaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of
bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or
muskrat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the South American
type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to the
islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in
geological structure, the inhabitants are essentially American,
though they may be all peculiar species. We may look back to past
ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then
prevailing on the American continent and in the American seas. We
see in these facts some deep organic bond, throughout space and
time, over the same areas of land and water, independently of
physical conditions. The naturalist must be dull who is not led to
inquire what this bond is.</p>
<p>The bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far
as we positively know, produces organisms quite like each other,
or, as we see in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The
dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be
attributed to modification through variation and natural selection,
and probably in a subordinate degree to the definite influence of
different physical conditions. The degrees of dissimilarity will
depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one
region into another having been more or less effectually prevented,
at periods more or less remote—on the nature and number of the
former immigrants—and on the action of the inhabitants on each
other in leading to the preservation of different modifications;
the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for life
being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of all
relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by
checking migration; as does time for the slow process of
modification through natural selection. Widely-ranging species,
abounding in individuals, which have already triumphed over many
competitors in their own widely-extended homes, will have the best
chance of seizing on new places, when they spread out into new
countries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new
conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and
improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious,
and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this principle
of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that
sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined
to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.</p>
<p>There is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of
the existence of any law of necessary development. As the
variability of each species is an independent property, and will be
taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it profits
each individual in its complex struggle for life, so the amount of
modification in different species will be no uniform quantity. If a
number of species, after having long competed with each other in
their old home, were to migrate in a body into a new and afterwards
isolated country, they would be little liable to modification; for
neither migration nor isolation in themselves effect anything.
These principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new
relations with each other and in a lesser degree with the
surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the last
chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character
from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species
have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at
all modified.</p>
<p>According to these views, it is obvious that the several species
of the same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of
the world, must originally have proceeded from the same source, as
they are descended from the same progenitor. In the case of those
species which have undergone, during whole geological periods,
little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that
they have migrated from the same region; for during the vast
geographical and climatical changes which have supervened since
ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in
many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the
species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent
times, there is great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious
that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting
distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot,
where their parents were first produced: for, as has been
explained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same
should have been produced from parents specifically distinct.</p>
