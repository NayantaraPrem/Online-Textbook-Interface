<p>In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which
might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume.
Most of them have now been discussed. One, namely, the distinctness
of specific forms and their not being blended together by
innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. I
assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the
present day under the circumstances apparently most favourable for
their presence, namely, on an extensive and continuous area with
graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to show, that the life
of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence
of other already defined organic forms, than on climate, and,
therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not
graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I
endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from
existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will
generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of
further modification and improvement. The main cause, however, of
innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere
throughout nature depends, on the very process of natural
selection, through which new varieties continually take the places
of and supplant their parent-forms. But just in proportion as this
process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must
the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed,
be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and
every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly
does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this,
perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be
urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the
extreme imperfection of the geological record.</p>
<p>In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort
of intermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed. I
have found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid
picturing to myself forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them. But
this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms
intermediate between each species and a common but unknown
progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some
respects from all its modified descendants. To give a simple
illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons are both descended
from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate
varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely
close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have
no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;
none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop
somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds.
These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if
we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin,
it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere
comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C.
livia, whether they had descended from this species or from some
other allied species, such as C. oenas.</p>
<p>So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for
instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that
links directly intermediate between them ever existed, but between
each and an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had
in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and
to the horse; but in some points of structure may have differed
considerably from both, even perhaps more than they differ from
each other. Hence, in all such cases, we should be unable to
recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we
closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its
modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a nearly
perfect chain of the intermediate links.</p>
<p>It is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms
might have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a
tapir; and in this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed
between them. But such a case would imply that one form had
remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants
had undergone a vast amount of change; and the principle of
competition between organism and organism, between child and
parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the
new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and
unimproved forms.</p>
<p>By the theory of natural selection all living species have been
connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not
greater than we see between the natural and domestic varieties of
the same species at the present day; and these parent-species, now
generally extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with
more ancient forms; and so on backwards, always converging to the
common ancestor of each great class. So that the number of
intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct
species, must have been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this
theory be true, such have lived upon the earth.</p>
