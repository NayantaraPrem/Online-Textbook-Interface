<p>Let us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to
the geological succession of organic beings accord best with the
common view of the immutability of species, or with that of their
slow and gradual modification, through variation and natural
selection.</p>
<p>New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both
on the land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly
possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the
several tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks
between the stages, and to make the proportion between the lost and
existing forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds,
though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one
or two species are extinct, and only one or two are new, having
appeared there for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we
know, on the face of the earth. The secondary formations are more
broken; but, as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor
disappearance of the many species embedded in each formation has
been simultaneous.</p>
<p>Species belonging to different genera and classes have not
changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the older
tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst
of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking
instance of a similar fact, for an existing crocodile is associated
with many lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits.
The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of
this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the
Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem
to have changed at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a
striking instance has been observed in Switzerland. There is some
reason to believe that organisms high in the scale, change more
quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to
this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is
not the same in each successive so-called formation. Yet if we
compare any but the most closely related formations, all the
species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species
has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have no reason
to believe that the same identical form ever reappears. The
strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of the
so-called "colonies" of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in
the midst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing
fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a
case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province,
seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>These several facts accord well with our theory, which includes
no fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area
to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The
process of modification must be slow, and will generally affect
only a few species at the same time; for the variability of each
species is independent of that of all others. Whether such
variations or individual differences as may arise will be
accumulated through natural selection in a greater or less degree,
thus causing a greater or less amount of permanent modification,
will depend on many complex contingencies—on the variations being
of a beneficial nature, on the freedom of intercrossing, on the
slowly changing physical conditions of the country, on the
immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of the other
inhabitants with which the varying species come into competition.
Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain
the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing,
should change in a less degree. We find similar relations between
the existing inhabitants of distinct countries; for instance, the
land-shells and coleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ
considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe,
whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can
perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in
terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with
marine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the
higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as
explained in a former chapter. When many of the inhabitants of any
area have become modified and improved, we can understand, on the
principle of competition, and from the all-important relations of
organism to organism in the struggle for life, that any form which
did not become in some degree modified and improved, would be
liable to extermination. Hence, we see why all the species in the
same region do at last, if we look to long enough intervals of
time, become modified; for otherwise they would become extinct.</p>
<p>In members of the same class the average amount of change,
during long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the
same; but as the accumulation of enduring formations, rich in
fossils, depends on great masses of sediment being deposited on
subsiding areas, our formations have been almost necessarily
accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals of time;
consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils
embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. Each formation, on
this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation, but
only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in an ever slowly
changing drama.</p>
<p>We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should
never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic
and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one
species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in
innumerable instances) to fill the place of another species in the
economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms—the old
and the new—would not be identically the same; for both would
almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct
progenitors; and organisms already differing would vary in a
different manner. For instance, it is possible, if all our
fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers might make a new
breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed; but if the
parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we
have every reason to believe that parent forms are generally
supplanted and exterminated by their improved offspring, it is
incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could
be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from any other
well established race of the domestic pigeon, for the successive
variations would almost certainly be in some degree different, and
the newly-formed variety would probably inherit from its progenitor
some characteristic differences.</p>
<p>Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same
general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single
species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser
degree. A group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears;
that is, its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am
aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the
exceptions are surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and
Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain)
admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with the theory. For
all the species of the same group, however long it may have lasted,
are the modified descendants one from the other, and all from a
common progenitor. In the genus Lingula, for instance, the species
which have successively appeared at all ages must have been
connected by an unbroken series of generations, from the lowest
Silurian stratum to the present day.</p>
<p>We have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species
sometimes falsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I
have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true
would be fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly
exceptional; the general rule being a gradual increase in number,
until the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, a
gradual decrease. If the number of the species included within a
genus, or the number of the genera within a family, be represented
by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending through the
successive geological formations, in which the species are found,
the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end,
not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens
upwards, often keeping of equal thickness for a space, and
ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and
final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of
the species of a group is strictly conformable with the theory; for
the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family,
can increase only slowly and progressively; the process of
modification and the production of a number of allied forms
necessarily being a slow and gradual process, one species first
giving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted
into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps
other varieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a
great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.</p>
