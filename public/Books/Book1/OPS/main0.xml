<p>Whether it is true or not that not more than twelve persons in
all the world are able to understand Einstein's Theory, it is
nevertheless a fact that there is a constant demand for information
about this much-debated topic of relativity. The books published on
the subject are so technical that only a person trained in pure
physics and higher mathematics is able to fully understand them. In
order to make a popular explanation of this far-reaching theory
available, the present book is published.</p>
<p>Professor Lorentz is credited by Einstein with sharing the
development of his theory. He is doubtless better able than any
other man—except the author himself—to explain this scientific
discovery.</p>
<p>The publishers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to the New
York&#160;<em>Times, The Review of Reviews</em>&#160;and<em>The
Athenaeum</em>&#160;for courteous permission to reprint articles
from their pages. Professor Lorentz's article appeared originally
in&#160;<em>The Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant&#160;</em>of November
19, 1919.</p>
