<h3 class="section_title">3. Character Of Domestic Varieties;
Difficulty Of Distinguishing Between Varieties And Species; Origin
Of Domestic Varieties From One Or More Species</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our
domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied
species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already
remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species.
Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which
I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other
species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often
differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared
one with another, and more especially when compared with the
species under nature to which they are nearest allied. With these
exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties
when crossed—a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races
of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do
the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature,
but the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must be
admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants
have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of
aboriginally distinct species, and by other competent judges as
mere varieties. If any well marked distinction existed between a
domestic race and a species, this source of doubt would not so
perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do
not differ from each other in characters of generic value. It can
be shown that this statement is not correct; but naturalists differ
much in determining what characters are of generic value; all such
valuations being at present empirical. When it is explained how
genera originate under nature, it will be seen that we have no
right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our
domesticated races.</p>
<p>In attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference
between allied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from
not knowing whether they are descended from one or several parent
species. This point, if it could be cleared up, would be
interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the
greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel and bull-dog, which we all
know propagate their kind truly, were the offspring of any single
species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt
about the immutability of the many closely allied natural
species—for instance, of the many foxes—inhabiting the different
quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently see,
that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of
the dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a
small part of the difference is due to their being descended from
distinct species. In the case of strongly marked races of some
other domesticated species, there is presumptive or even strong
evidence that all are descended from a single wild stock.</p>
<p>It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication
animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to
vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute
that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of
our domesticated productions; but how could a savage possibly know,
when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding
generations, and whether it would endure other climates? Has the
little variability of the ass and goose, or the small power of
endurance of warmth by the reindeer, or of cold by the common
camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other
animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated
productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and
countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to
breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they
would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our
existing domesticated productions have varied.</p>
<p>In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and
plants, it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion,
whether they are descended from one or several wild species. The
argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple
origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient
times, on the monuments of Egypt, and in the lake- habitations of
Switzerland, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of these
ancient breeds closely resemble, or are even identical with, those
still existing. But this only throws far backward the history of
civilisation, and shows that animals were domesticated at a much
earlier period than has hitherto been supposed. The
lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat
and barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed
several domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with
other nations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that
they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilisation;
and this again implies a long continued previous period of less
advanced civilisation, during which the domesticated animals, kept
by different tribes in different districts, might have varied and
given rise to distinct races. Since the discovery of flint tools in
the superficial formations of many parts of the world, all
geologists believe that barbarian men existed at an enormously
remote period; and we know that at the present day there is hardly
a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the
dog.</p>
<p>The origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever
remain vague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic
dogs of the whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of
all known facts, come to the conclusion that several wild species
of Canidae have been tamed, and that their blood, in some cases
mingled together, flows in the veins of our domestic breeds. In
regard to sheep and goats I can form no decided opinion. From facts
communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, constitution
and structure of the humped Indian cattle, it is almost certain
that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our
European cattle; and some competent judges believe that these
latter have had two or three wild progenitors, whether or not these
deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as well as that of
the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle, may,
indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable researches
of Professor Rutimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons which
I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in
opposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the
same species. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl
alive, having bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons,
it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the
wild Indian fowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr.
Blyth, and of others who have studied this bird in India. In regard
to ducks and rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each
other, the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the
common duck and wild rabbit.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from
several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by
some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let
the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild
prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of
species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe
alone, and several even within Great Britain. One author believes
that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar
to Great Britain! When we bear in mind that Britain has now not one
peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany,
and so with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms
possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must
admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in Europe; for
whence otherwise could they have been derived? So it is in India.
Even in the case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the
world, which I admit are descended from several wild species, it
cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of
inherited variation; for who will believe that animals closely
resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog,
pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.—so unlike all wild Canidae—ever
existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that
all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few
aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some
degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for
our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the
former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian
greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. Moreover,
the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been
greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record showing that a race
may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful
selection of the individuals which present the desired character;
but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races
would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented
with this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross
between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found
with pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems
simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another
for several generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the
difficulty of the task becomes manifest.</p>
