<h3 class="section_title">2. On The Absence Or Rarity Of
Transitional Varieties</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of
profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a
fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to
exterminate, its own less improved parent-form and other
less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus
extinction and natural selection go hand in hand. Hence, if we look
at each species as descended from some unknown form, both the
parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been
exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of
the new form.</p>
<p>But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have
existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in
the crust of the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this
question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological
record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly
lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is
generally supposed. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but
the natural collections have been imperfectly made, and only at
long intervals of time.</p>
<p>But it may be urged that when several closely allied species
inhabit the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present
time many transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in
travelling from north to south over a continent, we generally meet
at successive intervals with closely allied or representative
species, evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural
economy of the land. These representative species often meet and
interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other
becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other.
But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they are
generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of
structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by
each. By my theory these allied species are descended from a common
parent; and during the process of modification, each has become
adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and has
supplanted and exterminated its original parent-form and all the
transitional varieties between its past and present states. Hence
we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous
transitional varieties in each region, though they must have
existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. But
in the intermediate region, having intermediate conditions of life,
why do we not now find closely-linking intermediate varieties? This
difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. But I think it can
be in large part explained.</p>
<p>In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring,
because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous
during a long period. Geology would lead us to believe that most
continents have been broken up into islands even during the later
tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have
been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate
varieties existing in the intermediate zones. By changes in the
form of the land and of climate, marine areas now continuous must
often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and
uniform condition than at present. But I will pass over this way of
escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly
defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas;
though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas
now continuous, has played an important part in the formation of
new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering
animals.</p>
<p>In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide
area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large
territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the
confines, and finally disappearing. Hence the neutral territory
between two representative species is generally narrow in
comparison with the territory proper to each. We see the same fact
in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how
abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a common alpine
species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E. Forbes in
sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who look
at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important
elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as
climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we
bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis,
would increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other
competing species; that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey
for others; in short, that each organic being is either directly or
indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic
beingsâ€”we see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by
no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical
conditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on
which it lives, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes
into competition; and as these species are already defined objects,
not blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range
of any one species, depending as it does on the range of others,
will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species on the
confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will,
during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or
in the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter
extermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be
still more sharply defined.</p>
<p>As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a
continuous area, are generally distributed in such a manner that
each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral
territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer
and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from
species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we take
a varying species inhabiting a very large area, we shall have to
adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a
narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety, consequently,
will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser
area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds
good with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking
instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between
well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear
from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr.
Wollaston, that generally, when varieties intermediate between two
other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms
which they connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and
inferences, and conclude that varieties linking two other varieties
together generally have existed in lesser numbers than the forms
which they connect, then we can understand why intermediate
varieties should not endure for very long periods: why, as a
general rule, they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner
than the forms which they originally linked together.</p>
<p>For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already
remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one
existing in large numbers; and in this particular case the
intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of
closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. But it is a far
more important consideration, that during the process of further
modification, by which two varieties are supposed to be converted
and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in
larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great
advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller
numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in
larger numbers will have a better chance, within any given period,
of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection
to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser
numbers. Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will
tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be
more slowly modified and improved. It is the same principle which,
as I believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as
shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater
number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. I may
illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be
kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a
comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to the wide plains
at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal
steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the
chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great
holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds
more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow,
hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed
will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus
the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will
come into close contact with each other, without the interposition
of the supplanted, intermediate hill variety.</p>
<p>To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably
well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an
inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links: first,
because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a
slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until favourable
individual differences or variations occur, and until a place in
the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some
modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. And such new
places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional
immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more
important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly
modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting
and reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at any
one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight
modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this
assuredly we do see.</p>
<p>Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within
the recent period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more
especially among the classes which unite for each birth and wander
much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to
rank as representative species. In this case, intermediate
varieties between the several representative species and their
common parent, must formerly have existed within each isolated
portion of the land, but these links during the process of natural
selection will have been supplanted and exterminated, so that they
will no longer be found in a living state.</p>
<p>Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in
different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate
varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in the
intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short
duration. For these intermediate varieties will, from reasons
already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual
distribution of closely allied or representative species, and
likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate
zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to
connect. From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be
liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of
further modification through natural selection, they will almost
certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect;
for these, from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate,
present more varieties, and thus be further improved through
natural selection and gain further advantages.</p>
<p>Lastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my
theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely
together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have
existed; but the very process of natural selection constantly
tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent
forms and the intermediate links. Consequently evidence of their
former existence could be found only among fossil remains, which
are preserved, as we shall attempt to show in a future chapter, in
an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.</p>
