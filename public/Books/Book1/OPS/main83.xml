<h3 class="section_title">4. On The Absence Of Numerous
Intermediate Varieties In Any Single Formation</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>From these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the
geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but
if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much
more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely
graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its
commencement and at its close. Several cases are on record of the
same species presenting varieties in the upper and lower parts of
the same formation. Thus Trautschold gives a number of instances
with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf has described a most curious case of
ten graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis in the successive beds
of a fresh-water formation in Switzerland. Although each formation
has indisputably required a vast number of years for its
deposition, several reasons can be given why each should not
commonly include a graduated series of links between the species
which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign due
proportional weight to the following considerations.</p>
<p>Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years,
each probably is short compared with the period requisite to change
one species into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists,
whose opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and
Woodward, have concluded that the average duration of each
formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of
specific forms. But insuperable difficulties, as it seems to me,
prevent us from coming to any just conclusion on this head. When we
see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it
would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere
previously existed. So again, when we find a species disappearing
before the last layers have been deposited, it would be equally
rash to suppose that it then became extinct. We forget how small
the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world; nor have
the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been
correlated with perfect accuracy.</p>
<p>We may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there
has been a large amount of migration due to climatal and other
changes; and when we see a species first appearing in any
formation, the probability is that it only then first immigrated
into that area. It is well known, for instance, that several
species appear somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of North
America than in those of Europe; time having apparently been
required for their migration from the American to the European
seas. In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of the
world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing
species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the
immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now
abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this
particular deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the
ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during
the glacial epoch, which forms only a part of one whole geological
period; and likewise to reflect on the changes of level, on the
extreme change of climate, and on the great lapse of time, all
included within this same glacial period. Yet it may be doubted
whether, in any quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits,
INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on accumulating within the same
area during the whole of this period. It is not, for instance,
probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the
glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit
of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we know
that great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America
during this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in
shallow water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of
the glacial period shall have been upraised, organic remains will
probably first appear and disappear at different levels, owing to
the migrations of species and to geographical changes. And in the
distant future, a geologist, examining these beds, would be tempted
to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded
fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead of
having been really far greater, that is, extending from before the
glacial epoch to the present day.</p>
<p>In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the
upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have
gone on continuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient
for the slow process of modification; hence, the deposit must be a
very thick one; and the species undergoing change must have lived
in the same district throughout the whole time. But we have seen
that a thick formation, fossiliferous throughout its entire
thickness, can accumulate only during a period of subsidence; and
to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary that
the same marine species may live on the same space, the supply of
sediment must nearly counterbalance the amount of subsidence. But
this same movement of subsidence will tend to submerge the area
whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply,
whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly exact
balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of
subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed
by more than one palaeontologist that very thick deposits are
usually barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower
limits.</p>
<p>It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile
of formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in
its accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation
composed of beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we
may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more
or less interrupted. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation
give us any idea of the length of time which its deposition may
have consumed. Many instances could be given of beds, only a few
feet in thickness, representing formations which are elsewhere
thousands of feet in thickness, and which must have required an
enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this
fact would have even suspected the vast lapse of time represented
by the thinner formation. Many cases could be given of the lower
beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and
then re-covered by the upper beds of the same formationâ€”facts,
showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred
in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence
in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of
many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process
of deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not the
trees been preserved: thus Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found
carboniferous beds 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient
root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than
sixty-eight different levels. Hence, when the same species occurs
at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, the probability is
that it has not lived on the same spot during the whole period of
deposition, but has disappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times,
during the same geological period. Consequently if it were to
undergo a considerable amount of modification during the deposition
of any one geological formation, a section would not include all
the fine intermediate gradations which must on our theory have
existed, but abrupt, though perhaps slight, changes of form.</p>
<p>It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden
rule by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some
little variability to each species, but when they meet with a
somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they
rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them
together by the closest intermediate gradations; and this, from the
reasons just assigned, we can seldom hope to effect in any one
geological section. Supposing B and C to be two species, and a
third, A, to be found in an older and underlying bed; even if A
were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be
ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it
could be closely connected by intermediate varieties with either
one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained,
that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet would not
necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all respects.
So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified
descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same formation,
and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should
not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently
rank them as distinct species.</p>
<p>It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many
palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the
more readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the
same formation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many
of the very fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of
varieties; and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of
change which on the theory we ought to find. Look again at the
later tertiary deposits, which include many shells believed by the
majority of naturalists to be identical with existing species; but
some excellent naturalists, as Agassiz and Pictet, maintain that
all these tertiary species are specifically distinct, though the
distinction is admitted to be very slight; so that here, unless we
believe that these eminent naturalists have been misled by their
imaginations, and that these late tertiary species really present
no difference whatever from their living representatives, or unless
we admit, in opposition to the judgment of most naturalists, that
these tertiary species are all truly distinct from the recent, we
have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight modifications of
the kind required. If we look to rather wider intervals of time,
namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great
formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though universally
ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely related
to each other than are the species found in more widely separated
formations; so that here again we have undoubted evidence of change
in the direction required by the theory; but to this latter subject
I shall return in the following chapter.</p>
<p>With animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander
much, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that
their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local
varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until
they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree.
According to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in
any one country all the early stages of transition between any two
forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have
been local or confined to some one spot. Most marine animals have a
wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which
have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties, so that,
with shells and other marine animals, it is probable that those
which had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known
geological formations in Europe, have oftenest given rise, first to
local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would
greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of
transition in any one geological formation.</p>
<p>It is a more important consideration, leading to the same
result, as lately insisted on by Dr. Falconer, namely, that the
period during which each species underwent modification, though
long as measured by years, was probably short in comparison with
that during which it remained without undergoing any change.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with
perfect specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be
connected by intermediate varieties, and thus proved to be the same
species, until many specimens are collected from many places; and
with fossil species this can rarely be done. We shall, perhaps,
best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect
species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking
ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period
will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle, sheep,
horses, and dogs are descended from a single stock or from several
aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting
the shores of North America, which are ranked by some conchologists
as distinct species from their European representatives, and by
other conchologists as only varieties, are really varieties, or
are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This could be effected
by the future geologist only by his discovering in a fossil state
numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is improbable in
the highest degree.</p>
<p>It has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe
in the immutability of species, that geology yields no linking
forms. This assertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is
certainly erroneous. As Sir J. Lubbock has remarked, "Every species
is a link between other allied forms." If we take a genus having a
score of species, recent and extinct, and destroy four-fifths of
them, no one doubts that the remainder will stand much more
distinct from each other. If the extreme forms in the genus happen
to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself will stand more
distinct from other allied genera. What geological research has not
revealed, is the former existence of infinitely numerous
gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together
nearly all existing and extinct species. But this ought not to be
expected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious
objection against my views.</p>
<p>It may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the
causes of the imperfection of the geological record under an
imaginary illustration. The Malay Archipelago is about the size of
Europe from the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain
to Russia; and therefore equals all the geological formations which
have been examined with any accuracy, excepting those of the United
States of America. I fully agree with Mr. Godwin- Austen, that the
present condition of the Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large
islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably represents the
former state of Europe, while most of our formations were
accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions
in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected
which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent
the natural history of the world!</p>
<p>But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial
productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an extremely
imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there
accumulating. Not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of
those which lived on naked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and
those embedded in gravel or sand would not endure to a distant
epoch. Wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea,
or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect
organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved.</p>
<p>Formations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness
sufficient to last to an age as distant in futurity as the
secondary formations lie in the past, would generally be formed in
the archipelago only during periods of subsidence. These periods of
subsidence would be separated from each other by immense intervals
of time, during which the area would be either stationary or
rising; whilst rising, the fossiliferous formations on the steeper
shores would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the
incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores of South
America. Even throughout the extensive and shallow seas within the
archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of great
thickness during the periods of elevation, or become capped and
protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a good chance of
enduring to a very distant future. During the periods of
subsidence, there would probably be much extinction of life; during
the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the
geological record would then be less perfect.</p>
<p>It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period
of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together
with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the
average duration of the same specific forms; and these
contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the
transitional gradations between any two or more species. If such
gradations were not all fully preserved, transitional varieties
would merely appear as so many new, though closely allied species.
It is also probable that each great period of subsidence would be
interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatical
changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these
cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would migrate, and no
closely consecutive record of their modifications could be
preserved in any one formation.</p>
<p>Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range
thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy plainly leads
to the belief that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species,
though only some of them, which would oftenest produce new
varieties; and the varieties would at first be local or confined to
one place, but if possessed of any decided advantage, or when
further modified and improved, they would slowly spread and
supplant their parent-forms. When such varieties returned to their
ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state in a
nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, and as they
would be found embedded in slightly different sub-stages of the
same formation, they would, according to the principles followed by
many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species.</p>
<p>If then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have
no right to expect to find, in our geological formations, an
infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which, on our
theory, have connected all the past and present species of the same
group into one long and branching chain of life. We ought only to
look for a few links, and such assuredly we do findâ€”some more
distantly, some more closely, related to each other; and these
links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of
the same formation, would, by many palaeontologists, be ranked as
distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have
suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved geological
sections, had not the absence of innumerable transitional links
between the species which lived at the commencement and close of
each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory.</p>
