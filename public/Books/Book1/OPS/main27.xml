<p>How will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the
last chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of
selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man,
apply under nature? I think we shall see that it can act most
efficiently. Let the endless number of slight variations and
individual differences occurring in our domestic productions, and,
in a lesser degree, in those under nature, be borne in mind; as
well as the strength of the hereditary tendency. Under
domestication, it may truly be said that the whole organisation
becomes in some degree plastic. But the variability, which we
almost universally meet with in our domestic productions is not
directly produced, as Hooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by
man; he can neither originate varieties nor prevent their
occurrence; he can only preserve and accumulate such as do occur.
Unintentionally he exposes organic beings to new and changing
conditions of life, and variability ensues; but similar changes of
conditions might and do occur under nature. Let it also be borne in
mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual
relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical
conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied
diversities of structure might be of use to each being under
changing conditions of life. Can it then be thought improbable,
seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred,
that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great
and complex battle of life, should occur in the course of many
successive generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering
that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that
individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others,
would have the best chance of surviving and procreating their kind?
On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least
degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of
favourable individual differences and variations, and the
destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural
Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest. Variations neither
useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection,
and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see
in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed,
owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of the
conditions.</p>
<p>Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term
Natural Selection. Some have even imagined that natural selection
induces variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of
such variations as arise and are beneficial to the being under its
conditions of life. No one objects to agriculturists speaking of
the potent effects of man's selection; and in this case the
individual differences given by nature, which man for some object
selects, must of necessity first occur. Others have objected that
the term selection implies conscious choice in the animals which
become modified; and it has even been urged that, as plants have no
volition, natural selection is not applicable to them! In the
literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a false
term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective
affinities of the various elements?—and yet an acid cannot strictly
be said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It
has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power
or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction
of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Every one knows
what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and
they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to
avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by nature, only the
aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the
sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity
such superficial objections will be forgotten.</p>
<p>We shall best understand the probable course of natural
selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some slight
physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers
of its inhabitants will almost immediately undergo a change, and
some species will probably become extinct. We may conclude, from
what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the
inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in
the numerical proportions of the inhabitants, independently of the
change of climate itself, would seriously affect the others. If the
country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly
immigrate, and this would likewise seriously disturb the relations
of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how
powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has
been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country
partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted
forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the
economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some
of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had
the area been open to immigration, these same places would have
been seized on by intruders. In such cases, slight modifications,
which in any way favoured the individuals of any species, by better
adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be
preserved; and natural selection would have free scope for the work
of improvement.</p>
<p>We have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter,
that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased
variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed,
and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by
affording a better chance of the occurrence of profitable
variations. Unless such occur, natural selection can do nothing.
Under the term of "variations," it must never be forgotten that
mere individual differences are included. As man can produce a
great result with his domestic animals and plants by adding up in
any given direction individual differences, so could natural
selection, but far more easily from having incomparably longer time
for action. Nor do I believe that any great physical change, as of
climate, or any unusual degree of isolation, to check immigration,
is necessary in order that new and unoccupied places should be left
for natural selection to fill up by improving some of the varying
inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are
struggling together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight
modifications in the structure or habits of one species would often
give it an advantage over others; and still further modifications
of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage,
as long as the species continued under the same conditions of life
and profited by similar means of subsistence and defence. No
country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so
perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions
under which they live, that none of them could be still better
adapted or improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so
far conquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed
some foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as
foreigners have thus in every country beaten some of the natives,
we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified
with advantage, so as to have better resisted the intruders.</p>
<p>As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result
by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not
natural selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible
characters: Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural
preservation or survival of the fittest, cares nothing for
appearances, except in so far as they are useful to any being. She
can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional
difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for
his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.
Every selected character is fully exercised by her, as is implied
by the fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives of many
climates in the same country. He seldom exercises each selected
character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and
a short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a
long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he
exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate; does
not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females; he
does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during
each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his
productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous
form, or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch
the eye or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest
differences of structure or constitution may well turn the
nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be
preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How
short his time, and consequently how poor will be his results,
compared with those accumulated by Nature during whole geological
periods! Can we wonder, then, that Nature's productions should be
far "truer" in character than man's productions; that they should
be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of
life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher
workmanship?</p>
<p>It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily
and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest
variations; rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up
all that are good; silently and insensibly working, WHENEVER AND
WHEREVER OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, at the improvement of each organic
being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.
We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of
time has marked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is
our view into long-past geological ages that we see only that the
forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.</p>
<p>In order that any great amount of modification should be
effected in a species, a variety, when once formed must again,
perhaps after a long interval of time, vary or present individual
differences of the same favourable nature as before; and these must
again be preserved, and so onward, step by step. Seeing that
individual differences of the same kind perpetually recur, this can
hardly be considered as an unwarrantable assumption. But whether it
is true, we can judge only by seeing how far the hypothesis accords
with and explains the general phenomena of nature. On the other
hand, the ordinary belief that the amount of possible variation is
a strictly limited quantity, is likewise a simple assumption.</p>
<p>Although natural selection can act only through and for the good
of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to
consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When
we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey;
the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of
heather, we must believe that these tints are of service to these
birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not
destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in
countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of
prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,—so much so
that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white
pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence natural
selection might be effective in giving the proper colour to each
kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired,
true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional
destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce
little effect; we should remember how essential it is in a flock of
white sheep to destroy a lamb with the faintest trace of black. We
have seen how the colour of hogs, which feed on the "paint-root" in
Virginia, determines whether they shall live or die. In plants, the
down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by
botanists as characters of the most trifling importance; yet we
hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United
States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a
Curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more
from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease
attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other
coloured flesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight
differences make a great difference in cultivating the several
varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature, where the trees would
have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies, such
differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a
smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed fruit, should
succeed.</p>
<p>In looking at many small points of difference between species,
which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite
unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, etc., have no
doubt produced some direct effect. It is also necessary to bear in
mind that, owing to the law of correlation, when one part varies
and the variations are accumulated through natural selection, other
modifications, often of the most unexpected nature, will ensue.</p>
<p>As we see that those variations which, under domestication,
appear at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the
offspring at the same period; for instance, in the shape, size and
flavour of the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and
agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the
varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the
colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and
cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature natural selection
will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by
the accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and by their
inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have
its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see
no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural
selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by
selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural
selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of
contingencies, wholly different from those which concern the mature
insect; and these modifications may affect, through correlation,
the structure of the adult. So, conversely, modifications in the
adult may affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases
natural selection will ensure that they shall not be injurious: for
if they were so, the species would become extinct.</p>
<p>Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in
relation to the parent and of the parent in relation to the young.
In social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual
for the benefit of the whole community; if the community profits by
the selected change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify
the structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for
the good of another species; and though statements to this effect
may be found in works of natural history, I cannot find one case
which will bear investigation. A structure used only once in an
animal's life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to
any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws
possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for opening the
cocoon—or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds, used for
breaking the eggs. It has been asserted, that of the best
short-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg
than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act
of hatching. Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown
pigeon very short for the bird's own advantage, the process of
modification would be very slow, and there would be simultaneously
the most rigorous selection of all the young birds within the egg,
which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all with weak
beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more easily
broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell being
known to vary like every other structure.</p>
<p>It may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be
much fortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence
on the course of natural selection. For instance, a vast number of
eggs or seeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified
through natural selection only if they varied in some manner which
protected them from their enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds
would perhaps, if not destroyed, have yielded individuals better
adapted to their conditions of life than any of those which
happened to survive. So again a vast number of mature animals and
plants, whether or not they be the best adapted to their
conditions, must be annually destroyed by accidental causes, which
would not be in the least degree mitigated by certain changes of
structure or constitution which would in other ways be beneficial
to the species. But let the destruction of the adults be ever so
heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not wholly
kept down by such causes—or again let the destruction of eggs or
seeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are
developed—yet of those which do survive, the best adapted
individuals, supposing that there is any variability in a
favourable direction, will tend to propagate their kind in larger
numbers than the less well adapted. If the numbers be wholly kept
down by the causes just indicated, as will often have been the
case, natural selection will be powerless in certain beneficial
directions; but this is no valid objection to its efficiency at
other times and in other ways; for we are far from having any
reason to suppose that many species ever undergo modification and
improvement at the same time in the same area.</p>
