<h3 class="section_title">4. Instincts Of The Cuckoo</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause
of the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily,
but at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make
her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have
to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and
young birds of different ages in the same nest. If this were the
case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently
long, more especially as she migrates at a very early period; and
the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male
alone. But the American cuckoo is in this predicament, for she
makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all
at the same time. It has been both asserted and denied that the
American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests;
but I have lately heard from Dr. Merrill, of Iowa, that he once
found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the
nest of a blue jay (Garrulus cristatus); and as both were nearly
full feathered, there could be no mistake in their identification.
I could also give several instances of various birds which have
been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests.
Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our European
cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo, and that she
occasionally laid an egg in another bird's nest. If the old bird
profited by this occasional habit through being enabled to emigrate
earlier or through any other cause; or if the young were made more
vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken instinct of
another species than when reared by their own mother, encumbered as
she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different
ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered young
would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead us to believe that
the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the
occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn
would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be
more successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of
this nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo has
been generated. It has, also recently been ascertained on
sufficient evidence, by Adolf Muller, that the cuckoo occasionally
lays her eggs on the bare ground, sits on them and feeds her young.
This rare event is probably a case of reversion to the long-lost,
aboriginal instinct of nidification.</p>
<p>It has been objected that I have not noticed other related
instincts and adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are
spoken of as necessarily co-ordinated. But in all cases,
speculation on an instinct known to us only in a single species, is
useless, for we have hitherto had no facts to guide us. Until
recently the instincts of the European and of the non- parasitic
American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing to Mr. Ramsay's
observations, we have learned something about three Australian
species, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests. The chief
points to be referred to are three: first, that the common cuckoo,
with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the
large and voracious young bird receives ample food. Secondly, that
the eggs are remarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark—a
bird about one-fourth as large as the cuckoo. That the small size
of the egg is a real case of adaptation we may infer from the fact
of the mon-parasitic American cuckoo laying full-sized eggs.
Thirdly, that the young cuckoo, soon after birth, has the instinct,
the strength and a properly shaped back for ejecting its foster-
brothers, which then perish from cold and hunger. This has been
boldly called a beneficent arrangement, in order that the young
cuckoo may get sufficient food, and that its foster-brothers may
perish before they had acquired much feeling!</p>
<p>Turning now to the Australian species: though these birds
generally lay only one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two
and even three eggs in the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs
vary greatly in size, from eight to ten lines in length. Now, if it
had been of an advantage to this species to have laid eggs even
smaller than those now laid, so as to have deceived certain
foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to have been hatched
within a shorter period (for it is asserted that there is a
relation between the size of eggs and the period of their
incubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race
or species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and
smaller eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and
reared. Mr. Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when
they lay their eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference
for nests containing eggs similar in colour to their own. The
European species apparently manifests some tendency towards a
similar instinct, but not rarely departs from it, as is shown by
her laying her dull and pale-coloured eggs in the nest of the
hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs. Had our cuckoo
invariably displayed the above instinct, it would assuredly have
been added to those which it is assumed must all have been acquired
together. The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary, according
to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so that in
this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have
secured and fixed any advantageous variation.</p>
<p>In the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the
foster-parents are commonly ejected from the nest within three days
after the cuckoo is hatched; and as the latter at this age is in a
most helpless condition, Mr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe
that the act of ejection was performed by the foster-parents
themselves. But he has now received a trustworthy account of a
young cuckoo which was actually seen, while still blind and not
able even to hold up its own head, in the act of ejecting its
foster-brothers. One of these was replaced in the nest by the
observer, and was again thrown out. With respect to the means by
which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of
great importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to
receive as much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no
special difficulty in its having gradually acquired, during
successive generations, the blind desire, the strength, and
structure necessary for the work of ejection; for those cuckoos
which had such habits and structure best developed would be the
most securely reared. The first step towards the acquisition of the
proper instinct might have been mere unintentional restlessness on
the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced in age and
strength; the habit having been afterwards improved, and
transmitted to an earlier age. I can see no more difficulty in this
than in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct
to break through their own shells; or than in young snakes
acquiring in their upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory
sharp tooth for cutting through the tough egg-shell. For if each
part is liable to individual variations at all ages, and the
variations tend to be inherited at a corresponding or earlier
age—propositions which cannot be disputed—then the instincts and
structure of the young could be slowly modified as surely as those
of the adult; and both cases must stand or fall together with the
whole theory of natural selection.</p>
<p>Some species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American
birds, allied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of
the cuckoo; and the species present an interesting gradation in the
perfection of their instincts. The sexes of Molothrus badius are
stated by an excellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live
promiscuously together in flocks, and sometimes to pair. They
either build a nest of their own or seize on one belonging to some
other bird, occasionally throwing out the nestlings of the
stranger. They either lay their eggs in the nest thus appropriated,
or oddly enough build one for themselves on the top of it. They
usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own young; but Mr.
Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally parasitic,
for he has seen the young of this species following old birds of a
distinct kind and clamouring to be fed by them. The parasitic
habits of another species of Molothrus, the M. bonariensis, are
much more highly developed than those of the last, but are still
far from perfect. This bird, as far as it is known, invariably lays
its eggs in the nests of strangers; but it is remarkable that
several together sometimes commence to build an irregular untidy
nest of their own, placed in singular ill-adapted situations, as on
the leaves of a large thistle. They never, however, as far as Mr.
Hudson has ascertained, complete a nest for themselves. They often
lay so many eggs—from fifteen to twenty—in the same foster-nest,
that few or none can possibly be hatched. They have, moreover, the
extraordinary habit of pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their
own species or of their foster parents, which they find in the
appropriated nests. They drop also many eggs on the bare ground,
which are thus wasted. A third species, the M. pecoris of North
America, has acquired instincts as perfect as those of the cuckoo,
for it never lays more than one egg in a foster-nest, so that the
young bird is securely reared. Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever
in evolution, but he appears to have been so much struck by the
imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis that he quotes my
words, and asks, "Must we consider these habits, not as especially
endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one
general law, namely, transition?"</p>
<p>Various birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay
their eggs in the nests of other birds. This habit is not very
uncommon with the Gallinaceae, and throws some light on the
singular instinct of the ostrich. In this family several hen birds
unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another; and
these are hatched by the males. This instinct may probably be
accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of
eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days.
The instinct, however, of the American ostrich, as in the case of
the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet been perfected; for a
surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in
one day's hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted
eggs.</p>
<p>Many bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the
nests of other kinds of bees. This case is more remarkable than
that of the cuckoo; for these bees have not only had their
instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their
parasitic habits; for they do not possess the pollen-collecting
apparatus which would have been indispensable if they had stored up
food for their own young. Some species of Sphegidae (wasp-like
insects) are likewise parasitic; and M. Fabre has lately shown good
reason for believing that, although the Tachytes nigra generally
makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own
larvae, yet that, when this insect finds a burrow already made and
stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and
becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as with that of
the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural
selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to
the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are
feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.</p>
