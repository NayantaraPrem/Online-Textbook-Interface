<h3 class="section_title">4. Wide-Ranging, Much Diffused, And
Common Species Vary Most</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some
interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and
relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the
varieties in several well-worked floras. At first this seemed a
simple task; but Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I am much indebted for
valuable advice and assistance on this subject, soon convinced me
that there were many difficulties, as did subsequently Dr. Hooker,
even in stronger terms. I shall reserve for a future work the
discussion of these difficulties, and the tables of the
proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me
to add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined
the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well
established. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily
here is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions
cannot be avoided to the "struggle for existence," "divergence of
character," and other questions, hereafter to be discussed.</p>
<p>Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which
have very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might
have been expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical
conditions, and as they come into competition (which, as we shall
hereafter see, is a far more important circumstance) with different
sets of organic beings. But my tables further show that, in any
limited country, the species which are the most common, that is
abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely
diffused within their own country (and this is a different
consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from
commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently
well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is
the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant
species—those which range widely, are the most diffused in their
own country, and are the most numerous in individuals—which
oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them,
incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have been anticipated;
for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent,
necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the
country, the species which are already dominant will be the most
likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree
modified, still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents
to become dominant over their compatriots. In these remarks on
predominence, it should be understood that reference is made only
to the forms which come into competition with each other, and more
especially to the members of the same genus or class having nearly
similar habits of life. With respect to the number of individuals
or commonness of species, the comparison of course relates only to
the members of the same group. One of the higher plants may be said
to be dominant if it be more numerous in individuals and more
widely diffused than the other plants of the same country, which
live under nearly the same conditions. A plant of this kind is not
the less dominant because some conferva inhabiting the water or
some parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in individuals,
and more widely diffused. But if the conferva or parasitic fungus
exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then be dominant
within its own class.</p>
