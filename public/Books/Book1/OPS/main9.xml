<h3 class="section_title">6. Unconscious Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical
selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or
sub-breed, superior to anything of the kind in the country. But,
for our purpose, a form of selection, which may be called
unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and
breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a
man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good
dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but
he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed.
Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during
centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as
Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on
more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes,
the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible
changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual
measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have
been made long ago, which may serve for comparison. In some cases,
however, unchanged, or but little changed, individuals of the same
breed exist in less civilised districts, where the breed has been
less improved. There is reason to believe that King Charles'
spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the
time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are
convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and
has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the
English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century,
and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly
effected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is,
that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and
yet so effectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly
came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him,
any native dog in Spain like our pointer.</p>
<p>By a similar process of selection, and by careful training,
English race- horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the
parent Arabs, so that the latter, by the regulations for the
Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights which they carry. Lord
Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have
increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock
formerly kept in this country. By comparing the accounts given in
various old treatises of the former and present state of carrier
and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and Persia, we can trace the
stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to
differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.</p>
<p>Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a
course of selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so
far that the breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to
produce the result which ensued—namely, the production of the
distinct strains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr.
Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, "Have been purely
bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty
years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at
all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them
has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep
possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the
appearance of being quite different varieties."</p>
<p>If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the
inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet
any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special
purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other
accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals
would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones;
so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection
going on. We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of
Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women,
in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.</p>
<p>In plants the same gradual process of improvement through the
occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not
sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as
distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races
have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised
in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties
of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants,
when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks.
No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia
from the seed of a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a
first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he
might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come
from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical
times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of
very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in
horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having
produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the
art has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned,
has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always
cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a
slightly better variety chanced to appear, selecting it, and so
onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated
the best pears which they could procure, never thought what
splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit in
some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved
the best varieties they could anywhere find.</p>
<p>A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously
accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a
number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the
wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated
in our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or
thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to
their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how
it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other
region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single
plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in
species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks
of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been
improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection
comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries anciently
civilised.</p>
<p>In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it
should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle
for their own food, at least during certain seasons. And in two
countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same
species, having slightly different constitutions or structure,
would often succeed better in the one country than in the other,
and thus by a process of "natural selection," as will hereafter be
more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This,
perhaps, partly explains why the varieties kept by savages, as has
been remarked by some authors, have more of the character of true
species than the varieties kept in civilised countries.</p>
<p>On the view here given of the important part which selection by
man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our
domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their
habits to man's wants or fancies. We can, I think, further
understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races,
and likewise their differences being so great in external
characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs.
Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation
of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he
rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection,
excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight
degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till he
saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an
unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of
somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any
character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be
to catch his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to
make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly
incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly
larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon
would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly
methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had
only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present
Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in
which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps
the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the
turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus—a habit which is
disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the
breed.</p>
<p>Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure
would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives
extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any
novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the
value which would formerly have been set on any slight differences
in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value
which is now set on them, after several breeds have fairly been
established. It is known that with pigeons many slight variations
now occasionally appear, but these are rejected as faults or
deviations from the standard of perfection in each breed. The
common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the
Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that
most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct
at our poultry-shows.</p>
<p>These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed,
namely, that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of
any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect
of a language, can hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man
preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation
of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best
animals, and thus improves them, and the improved animals slowly
spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly
have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their
history will have been disregarded. When further improved by the
same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and
will be recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will
then probably first receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised
countries, with little free communication, the spreading of a new
sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the points of value
are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of
unconscious selection will always tend—perhaps more at one period
than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion—perhaps
more in one district than in another, according to the state of
civilisation of the inhabitants—slowly to add to the characteristic
features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be
infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow,
varying, and insensible changes.</p>
