<h3 class="section_title">2. On The Inhabitants Of Oceanic
Islands</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I
have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with
respect to distribution, on the view that not only all the
individuals of the same species have migrated from some one area,
but that allied species, although now inhabiting the most distant
points, have proceeded from a single area, the birthplace of their
early progenitors. I have already given my reasons for disbelieving
in continental extensions within the period of existing species on
so enormous a scale that all the many islands of the several oceans
were thus stocked with their present terrestrial inhabitants. This
view removes many difficulties, but it does not accord with all the
facts in regard to the productions of islands. In the following
remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of
dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on the truth
of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with
modification.</p>
<p>The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few
in number compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de
Candolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New
Zealand, for instance, with its lofty mountains and diversified
stations, extending over 780 miles of latitude, together with the
outlying islands of Auckland, Campbell and Chatham, contain
altogether only 960 kinds of flowering plants; if we compare this
moderate number with the species which swarm over equal areas in
Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope, we must admit
that some cause, independently of different physical conditions,
has given rise to so great a difference in number. Even the uniform
county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of
Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are
included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other
respects is not quite fair. We have evidence that the barren island
of Ascension aboriginally possessed less than half-a-dozen
flowering plants; yet many species have now become naturalised on
it, as they have in New Zealand and on every other oceanic island
which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason to believe that
the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite
exterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of
the creation of each separate species, will have to admit that a
sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals were not
created for oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked
them far more fully and perfectly than did nature.</p>
<p>Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the
proportion of endemic kinds (i.e. those found nowhere else in the
world) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the
number of endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in
the Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent,
and then compare the area of the island with that of the continent,
we shall see that this is true. This fact might have been
theoretically expected, for, as already explained, species
occasionally arriving, after long intervals of time in the new and
isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, would
be eminently liable to modification, and would often produce groups
of modified descendants. But it by no means follows that, because
in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar,
those of another class, or of another section of the same class,
are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend partly on the
species which are not modified having immigrated in a body, so that
their mutual relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on
the frequent arrival of unmodified immigrants from the
mother-country, with which the insular forms have intercrossed. It
should be borne in mind that the offspring of such crosses would
certainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional cross would
produce more effect than might have been anticipated. I will give a
few illustrations of the foregoing remarks: in the Galapagos
Islands there are twenty-six land birds; of these twenty-one (or
perhaps twenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven marine
birds only two are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds
could arrive at these islands much more easily and frequently than
land-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the
same distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from
South America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess
a single endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.M. Jones's
admirable account of Bermuda, that very many North American birds
occasionally or even frequently visit this island. Almost every
year, as I am informed by Mr. E.V. Harcourt, many European and
African birds are blown to Madeira; this island is inhabited by
ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is peculiar, though very
closely related to a European form; and three or four other species
are confined to this island and to the Canaries. So that the
islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the
neighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there
struggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted. Hence,
when settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by
the others to its proper place and habits, and will consequently
have been but little liable to modification. Any tendency to
modification will also have been checked by intercrossing with the
unmodified immigrants, often arriving from the mother-country.
Madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar
land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is peculiar to
its shores: now, though we do not know how sea-shells are
dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps
attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading
birds, might be transported across three or four hundred miles of
open sea far more easily than land-shells. The different orders of
insects inhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.</p>
<p>Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain
whole classes, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus
in the Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic
wingless birds, take, or recently took, the place of mammals.
Although New Zealand is here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is
in some degree doubtful whether it should be so ranked; it is of
large size, and is not separated from Australia by a profoundly
deep sea; from its geological character and the direction of its
mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B. Clarke has lately maintained that
this island, as well as New Caledonia, should be considered as
appurtenances of Australia. Turning to plants, Dr. Hooker has shown
that in the Galapagos Islands the proportional numbers of the
different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere.
All such differences in number, and the absence of certain whole
groups of animals and plants, are generally accounted for by
supposed differences in the physical conditions of the islands; but
this explanation is not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration
seems to have been fully as important as the nature of the
conditions.</p>
<p>Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the
inhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands
not tenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have
beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than
that hooks serve for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of
quadrupeds. But a hooked seed might be carried to an island by
other means; and the plant then becoming modified would form an
endemic species, still retaining its hooks, which would form a
useless appendage, like the shrivelled wings under the soldered
wing-covers of many insular beetles. Again, islands often possess
trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only
herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown,
generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence
trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and
an herbaceous plant, which had no chance of successfully competing
with the many fully developed trees growing on a continent, might,
when established on an island, gain an advantage over other
herbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping
them. In this case, natural selection would tend to add to the
stature of the plant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first
convert it into a bush and then into a tree.</p>
