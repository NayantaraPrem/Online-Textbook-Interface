<h3 class="section_title">2. Effects Of Habit And Of The Use Or
Disuse Of Parts; Correlated Variation; Inheritance</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of
the flowering of plants when transported from one climate to
another. With animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had
a more marked influence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the
bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in
proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the
wild duck; and this change may be safely attributed to the domestic
duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parents. The
great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in
countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with
these organs in other countries, is probably another instance of
the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be named
which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which has
been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of
the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems
probable.</p>
<p>Many laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly
seen, and will hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only
allude to what may be called correlated variation. Important
changes in the embryo or larva will probably entail changes in the
mature animal. In monstrosities, the correlations between quite
distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in
Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this subject. Breeders
believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an
elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical;
thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally
deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is
confined to the males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities go
together, of which many remarkable cases could be given among
animals and plants. From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears
that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, while
dark-coloured individuals escape: Professor Wyman has recently
communicated to me a good illustration of this fact; on asking some
farmers in Virginia how it was that all their pigs were black, they
informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root (Lachnanthes), which
coloured their bones pink, and which caused the hoofs of all but
the black varieties to drop off; and one of the "crackers" (i.e.
Virginia squatters) added, "we select the black members of a litter
for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living." Hairless
dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals
are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with
feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with
short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet.
Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any
peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other
parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of
correlation.</p>
<p>The results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood
laws of variation are infinitely complex and diversified. It is
well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some
of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the
dahlia, etc.; and it is really surprising to note the endless
points of structure and constitution in which the varieties and
sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole
organisation seems to have become plastic, and departs in a slight
degree from that of the parental type.</p>
<p>Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But
the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure,
both those of slight and those of considerable physiological
importance, are endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large
volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder
doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance; that like
produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on
this principle only by theoretical writers. When any deviation of
structure often appears, and we see it in the father and child, we
cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having
acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently exposed to
the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some
extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the
parent—say, once among several million individuals—and it reappears
in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to
attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have
heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc.,
appearing in several members of the same family. If strange and
rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and
commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable.
Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be, to
look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule,
and non-inheritance as the anomaly.</p>
<p>The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no
one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of
the same species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited
and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain
characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote
ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to
both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively
to the like sex. It is a fact of some importance to us, that
peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are
often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much greater degree,
to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may
be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first
appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding
age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be
otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle
could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature;
peculiarities in the silk-worm are known to appear at the
corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases
and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider
extension, and that, when there is no apparent reason why a
peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does
tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it
first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the
highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These
remarks are of course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the
peculiarity, and not to the primary cause which may have acted on
the ovules or on the male element; in nearly the same manner as the
increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short-horned
cow by a long-horned bull, though appearing late in life, is
clearly due to the male element.</p>
<p>Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to
a statement often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic
varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in
character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that
no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a
state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what
decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been
made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may
safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic
varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we
do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell
whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be
necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that
only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home.
Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in
some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not
improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to
cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for
instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil—in which case, however,
some effect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of
the poor soil —that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly,
revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment
would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument;
for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If
it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong
tendency to reversion—that is, to lose their acquired characters,
while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a
considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by
blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in
such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic
varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of
evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed
our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry
of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number
of generations, would be opposed to all experience.</p>
