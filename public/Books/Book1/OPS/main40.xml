<h3 class="section_title">2. Effects Of The Increased Use And
Disuse Of Parts, As Controlled By Natural Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there
can be no doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened
and enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that
such modifications are inherited. Under free nature we have no
standard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of
long-continued use or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but
many animals possess structures which can be best explained by the
effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked, there is no
greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there
are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America
can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in
nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is a
remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham,
can fly, while the adults have lost this power. As the larger
ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it
is probable that the nearly wingless condition of several birds,
now inhabiting or which lately inhabited several oceanic islands,
tenanted by no beasts of prey, has been caused by disuse. The
ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and is exposed to danger from
which it cannot escape by flight, but it can defend itself, by
kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many quadrupeds. We may
believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had habits like
those of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of its body
were increased during successive generations, its legs were used
more and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.</p>
<p>Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the
anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are
often broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own
collection, and not one had even a relic left. In the Onites
apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost that the insect has been
described as not having them. In some other genera they are
present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the Ateuchus or sacred
beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient. The evidence
that accidental mutilations can be inherited is at present not
decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by Brown-Sequard in
guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations, should make us
cautious in denying this tendency. Hence, it will perhaps be safest
to look at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus,
and their rudimentary condition in some other genera, not as cases
of inherited mutilations, but as due to the effects of
long-continued disuse; for as many dung-feeding beetles are
generally found with their tarsi lost, this must happen early in
life; therefore the tarsi cannot be of much importance or be much
used by these insects.</p>
<p>In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications
of structure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection.
Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles,
out of the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira,
are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of
the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all
their species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that
beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea
and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr.
Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun
shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the
exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the
extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that
certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous,
which absolutely require the use of their wings, are here almost
entirely absent. These several considerations make me believe that
the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to
the action of natural selection, combined probably with disuse. For
during many successive generations each individual beetle which
flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little less
perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best
chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the
other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight would
oftenest have been blown to sea, and thus destroyed.</p>
<p>The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which,
as certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must
habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr.
Wollaston suspects, their wings not at all reduced, but even
enlarged. This is quite compatible with the action of natural
selection. For when a new insect first arrived on the island, the
tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings,
would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved
by successfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the
attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners shipwrecked
near a coast, it would have been better for the good swimmers if
they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would have
been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim
at all and had stuck to the wreck.</p>
<p>The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary
in size, and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This
state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse,
but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a
burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more
subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a
Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently
blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the
cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the
nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be
injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to
animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with
the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in
such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid
the effects of disuse.</p>
<p>It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most
different classes, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and
Kentucky, are blind. In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the
eye remains, though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is
there, though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. As it
is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any
way injurious to animals living in darkness, their loss may be
attributed to disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely, the
cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were captured by Professor
Silliman at above half a mile distance from the mouth of the cave,
and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were lustrous
and of large size; and these animals, as I am informed by Professor
Silliman, after having been exposed for about a month to a
graduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than
deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in
accordance with the old view of the blind animals having been
separately created for the American and European caverns, very
close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have
been expected. This is certainly not the case if we look at the two
whole faunas; with respect to the insects alone, Schiodte has
remarked: "We are accordingly prevented from considering the entire
phenomenon in any other light than something purely local, and the
similarity which is exhibited in a few forms between the Mammoth
Cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola, otherwise than as a
very plain expression of that analogy which subsists generally
between the fauna of Europe and of North America." On my view we
must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary
powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from
the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky
caves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have
some evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks:
"We accordingly look upon the subterranean faunas as small
ramifications which have penetrated into the earth from the
geographically limited faunas of the adjacent tracts, and which, as
they extended themselves into darkness, have been accommodated to
surrounding circumstances. Animals not far remote from ordinary
forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow
those that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those
destined for total darkness, and whose formation is quite
peculiar." These remarks of Schiodte's it should be understood,
apply not to the same, but to distinct species. By the time that an
animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest
recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly
obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have
effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the
antennae or palpi, as a compensation for blindness. Notwithstanding
such modifications, we might expect still to see in the
cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants of
that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the
European continent. And this is the case with some of the American
cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the
European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the
surrounding country. It would be difficult to give any rational
explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the
other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of
their independent creation. That several of the inhabitants of the
caves of the Old and New Worlds should be closely related, we might
expect from the well-known relationship of most of their other
productions. As a blind species of Bathyscia is found in abundance
on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in the cave
species of this one genus has probably had no relation to its dark
habitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of
vision should readily become adapted to dark caverns. Another blind
genus (Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the
species, as Mr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found
anywhere except in caves; yet those which inhabit the several caves
of Europe and America are distinct; but it is possible that the
progenitors of these several species, while they were furnished
with eyes, may formerly have ranged over both continents, and then
have become extinct, excepting in their present secluded abodes.
Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be
very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind
fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus,
with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that
more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the
less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these
dark abodes will have been exposed.</p>
