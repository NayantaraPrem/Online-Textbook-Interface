<h3 class="section_title">4. On The Intercrossing Of
Individuals</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals
and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two
individuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not
well understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but
in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious.
Nevertheless there is reason to believe that with all
hermaphrodites two individuals, either occasionally or habitually,
concur for the reproduction of their kind. This view was long ago
doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and Kolreuter. We shall
presently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject
with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an
ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects and some
other large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research
has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of
real hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals
regularly unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us.
But still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do
not habitually pair, and a vast majority of plants are
hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be asked, is there for
supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in
reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I must
trust to some general considerations alone.</p>
<p>In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts,
and made so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the
almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a
cross between different varieties, or between individuals of the
same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to
the offspring; and on the other hand, that CLOSE interbreeding
diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me
to believe that it is a general law of nature that no organic being
fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations; but that a cross
with another individual is occasionally—perhaps at long intervals
of time—indispensable.</p>
<p>On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think,
understand several large classes of facts, such as the following,
which on any other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows
how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a
flower, yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and
stigmas fully exposed to the weather! If an occasional cross be
indispensable, notwithstanding that the plant's own anthers and
pistil stand so near each other as almost to ensure self-
fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from
another individual will explain the above state of exposure of the
organs. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of
fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or
pea-family; but these almost invariably present beautiful and
curious adaptations in relation to the visits of insects. So
necessary are the visits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers,
that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be
prevented. Now, it is scarcely possible for insects to fly from
flower to flower, and not to carry pollen from one to the other, to
the great good of the plant. Insects act like a camel-hair pencil,
and it is sufficient, to ensure fertilisation, just to touch with
the same brush the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of
another; but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a
multitude of hybrids between distinct species; for if a plant's own
pollen and that from another species are placed on the same stigma,
the former is so prepotent that it invariably and completely
destroys, as has been shown by Gartner, the influence of the
foreign pollen.</p>
<p>When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil,
or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance
seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it
is useful for this end: but the agency of insects is often required
to cause the stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to
be the case with the barberry; and in this very genus, which seems
to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well
known that, if closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near
each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so
largely do they naturally cross. In numerous other cases, far from
self-fertilisation being favoured, there are special contrivances
which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own
flower, as I could show from the works of Sprengel and others, as
well as from my own observations: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens,
there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which all
the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the
conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that
individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is
never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a
seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of
another, I raise plenty of seedlings. Another species of Lobelia,
which is visited by bees, seeds freely in my garden. In very many
other cases, though there is no special mechanical contrivance to
prevent the stigma receiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as
Sprengel, and more recently Hildebrand and others have shown, and
as I can confirm, either the anthers burst before the stigma is
ready for fertilisation, or the stigma is ready before the pollen
of that flower is ready, so that these so-named dichogamous plants
have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. So it
is with the reciprocally dimorphic and trimorphic plants previously
alluded to. How strange are these facts! How strange that the
pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower, though placed so
close together, as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation,
should be in so many cases mutually useless to each other! How
simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross
with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!</p>
<p>If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some
other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority
of the seedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for
instance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of
different varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78
were true to their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly
true. Yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only
by its own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on
the same plant; and the pollen of each flower readily gets on its
stigma without insect agency; for I have found that plants
carefully protected from insects produce the full number of pods.
How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are
mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct VARIETY
having a prepotent effect over the flower's own pollen; and that
this is part of the general law of good being derived from the
intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When
distinct SPECIES are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant's
own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this
subject we shall return in a future chapter.</p>
<p>In the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it
may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to
tree, and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree; and
flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals
only in a limited sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but
that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a
strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. When the
sexes are separated, although the male and female flowers may be
produced on the same tree, pollen must be regularly carried from
flower to flower; and this will give a better chance of pollen
being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That trees belonging
to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other
plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request
Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray
those of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On
the other hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that the rule does not hold
good in Australia: but if most of the Australian trees are
dichogamous, the same result would follow as if they bore flowers
with separated sexes. I have made these few remarks on trees simply
to call attention to the subject.</p>
<p>Turning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial
species are hermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and
earth-worms; but these all pair. As yet I have not found a single
terrestrial animal which can fertilise itself. This remarkable
fact, which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, is
intelligible on the view of an occasional cross being
indispensable; for owing to the nature of the fertilising element
there are no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the
wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected
with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two
individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising
hermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious
means for an occasional cross. As in the case of flowers, I have as
yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities,
namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal
with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access
from without, and the occasional influence of a distinct
individual, can be shown to be physically impossible. Cirripedes
long appeared to me to present, under this point of view, a case of
great difficulty; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance,
to prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising
hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.</p>
<p>It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that,
both with animals and plants, some species of the same family and
even of the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in
their whole organisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual.
But if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the
difference between them and unisexual species is, as far as
function is concerned, very small.</p>
<p>From these several considerations and from the many special
facts which I have collected, but which I am unable here to give,
it appears that with animals and plants an occasional intercross
between distinct individuals is a very general, if not universal,
law of nature.</p>
