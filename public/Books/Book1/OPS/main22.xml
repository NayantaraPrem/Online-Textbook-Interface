<h3 class="section_title">3. Geometrical Ratio Of Increase</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate
at which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which
during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must
suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some
season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of
geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so
inordinately great that no country could support the product.
Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive,
there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one
individual with another of the same species, or with the
individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of
life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to
the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can
be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from
marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less
rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold
them.</p>
<p>There is no exception to the rule that every organic being
naturally increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the
earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even
slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this
rate, in less than a thousand years, there would literally not be
standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an
annual plant produced only two seeds—and there is no plant so
unproductive as this—and their seedlings next year produced two,
and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants.
The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals,
and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate
of natural increase; it will be safest to assume that it begins
breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety
years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and surviving
till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of from
740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants
alive descended from the first pair.</p>
<p>But we have better evidence on this subject than mere
theoretical calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of
the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of
nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two
or three following seasons. Still more striking is the evidence
from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in
several parts of the world; if the statements of the rate of
increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and
latterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would
have been incredible. So it is with plants; cases could be given of
introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands
in a period of less than ten years. Several of the plants, such as
the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the commonest over
the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface
almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been introduced
from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India, as I
hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which
have been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases,
and endless others could be given, no one supposes that the
fertility of the animals or plants has been suddenly and
temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious
explanation is that the conditions of life have been highly
favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction
of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been
enabled to breed. Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result
of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their
extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new
homes.</p>
<p>In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually
produces seed, and among animals there are very few which do not
annually pair. Hence we may confidently assert that all plants and
animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio—that all
would rapidly stock every station in which they could any how
exist, and that this geometrical tendency to increase must be
checked by destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with
the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us; we see
no great destruction falling on them, and we do not keep in mind
that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a
state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed
of.</p>
<p>The only difference between organisms which annually produce
eggs or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely
few, is, that the slow breeders would require a few more years to
people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be
ever so large. The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a
score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the more
numerous of the two. The Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is
believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. One fly
deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a
single one. But this difference does not determine how many
individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. A
large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which
depend on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly
to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number of
eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of
life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early
one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a
small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully
kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be
produced or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to
keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a
thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand
years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be
ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so that, in all cases, the
average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on
the number of its eggs or seeds.</p>
<p>In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing
considerations always in mind—never to forget that every single
organic being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase
in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its
life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young
or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten
any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number
of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any
amount.</p>
