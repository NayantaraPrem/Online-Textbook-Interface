<h3 class="section_title">6. Cell-Making Instinct Of The
Hive-Bee</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but
will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which I have
arrived. He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite
structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without
enthusiastic admiration. We hear from mathematicians that bees have
practically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells
of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey,
with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their
construction. It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with
fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make
cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected by a crowd
of bees working in a dark hive. Granting whatever instincts you
please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all
the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are
correctly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as at
first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to
follow from a few simple instincts.</p>
<p>I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has
shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the
presence of adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps,
be considered only as a modification of his theory. Let us look to
the great principle of gradation, and see whether Nature does not
reveal to us her method of work. At one end of a short series we
have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey,
sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making
separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At the other end
of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double
layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the
basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted
pyramid, of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the
three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of
the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three
adjoining cells on the opposite side. In the series between the
extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity
of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican
Melipona domestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre
Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the
hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it
forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which
the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax
for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of
nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But
the important point to notice is, that these cells are always made
at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have
intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been
completed; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly
flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect.
Hence, each cell consists of an outer spherical portion, and of
two, three, or more flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins
two, three or more other cells. When one cell rests on three other
cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is
very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces
are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked,
is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal base
of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so
here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter
into the construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that
the Melipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this
manner of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells
are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer
spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two
cells.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona
had made its spheres at some given distance from each other, and
had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in
a double layer, the resulting structure would have been as perfect
as the comb of the hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor
Miller, of Cambridge, and this geometer has kindly read over the
following statement, drawn up from his information, and tells me
that it is strictly correct:-</p>
<p>If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres
placed in two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at
the distance of radius x sqrt(2) or radius x 1.41421 (or at some
lesser distance), from the centres of the six surrounding spheres
in the same layer; and at the same distance from the centres of the
adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer; then, if planes
of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be
formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united
together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the rhombs
and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle
identically the same with the best measurements which have been
made of the cells of the hive-bee. But I hear from Professor Wyman,
who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of
the workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much
so, that whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is
rarely, if ever, realised.</p>
<p>Hence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify
the instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves
not very wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully
perfect as that of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to
have the power of forming her cells truly spherical, and of equal
sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she
already does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly
cylindrical burrows many insects make in wood, apparently by
turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose the Melipona to
arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her
cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the
greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what
distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making
their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of
distance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect
to a certain extent; and then she unites the points of intersection
by perfectly flat surfaces. By such modifications of instincts
which in themselves are not very wonderful—hardly more wonderful
than those which guide a bird to make its nest—I believe that the
hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable
architectural powers.</p>
<p>But this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the
example of Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between
them a long, thick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly
began to excavate minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened
these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were
converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true
or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell. It was
most interesting to observe that, wherever several bees had begun
to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work
at such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had
acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the width of an
ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter
of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the basins
intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred, the
bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax on
the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each
hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth
basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as
in the case of ordinary cells.</p>
<p>I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece
of wax, a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with
vermilion. The bees instantly began on both sides to excavate
little basins near to each other, in the same way as before; but
the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of the basins, if
they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former
experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite
sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they
stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon
as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bases; and
these flat bases, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax
left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge,
exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the
basins on the opposite side of the ridge of wax. In some parts,
only small portions, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic
plate were thus left between the opposed basins, but the work, from
the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly performed. The
bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate in circularly
gnawing away and deepening the basins on both sides of the ridge of
vermilion wax, in order to have thus succeeded in leaving flat
plates between the basins, by stopping work at the planes of
intersection.</p>
<p>Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is
any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a
strip of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the
proper thinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it
has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working
at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have
noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell,
which were slightly concave on one side, where I suppose that the
bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side
where the bees had worked less quickly. In one well-marked
instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees
to go on working for a short time, and again examined the cell, and
I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had become
PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme
thinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by
gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such
cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and
warm wax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper
intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.</p>
<p>From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see
that, if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax,
they could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the
proper distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate,
and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never
allowing the spheres to break into each other. Now bees, as may be
clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a
rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the comb; and they
gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always working circularly
as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole three-sided
pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only that one
rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the
two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper
edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are
commenced. Some of these statements differ from those made by the
justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of their
accuracy; and if I had space, I could show that they are
conformable with my theory.</p>
<p>Huber's statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of
a little parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen,
strictly correct; the first commencement having always been a
little hood of wax; but I will not here enter on details. We see
how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the
cells; but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees
cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position—that is,
along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres. I
have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this. Even
in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing
comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position
to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. But the
rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being
largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees
build is curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to
twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the
cell, which will ultimately be left. We shall understand how they
work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement,
and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the
ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the
masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh
cement on the summit of the ridge. We shall thus have a thin wall
steadily growing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping.
From all the cells, both those just commenced and those completed,
being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster
and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal
walls. These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained for
me, vary greatly in thickness; being, on an average of twelve
measurements made near the border of the comb, 1/352 of an inch in
thickness; whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly
in the proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from
twenty-one measurements, of 1/229 of an inch. By the above singular
manner of building, strength is continually given to the comb, with
the utmost ultimate economy of wax.</p>
<p>It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how
the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one
bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so
that, as Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the
commencement of the first cell. I was able practically to show this
fact, by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single
cell, or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing
comb, with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax; and I
invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by
the bees—as delicately as a painter could have done it with his
brush—by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot
on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of
the cells all round. The work of construction seems to be a sort of
balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the
same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal
spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of
intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to note
in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,
how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways
the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at
first rejected.</p>
<p>When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper
positions for working—for instance, on a slip of wood, placed
directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the
comb has to be built over one face of the slip—in this case the
bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its
strictly proper place, projecting beyond the other completed cells.
It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their
proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the
last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they
can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres;
but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the
angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the
adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying
down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place
between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a
fact, which seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory;
namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are
sometimes strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on
this subject. Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a
single insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal
cells, if she were to work alternately on the inside and outside of
two or three cells commenced at the same time, always standing at
the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just
begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate
planes.</p>
<p>As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight
modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the
individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be
asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified
architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect
plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the
hive-bee? I think the answer is not difficult: cells constructed
like those of the bee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much
in labour and space, and in the materials of which they are
constructed. With respect to the formation of wax, it is known that
bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am
informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved
that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a
hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a
prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed
by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for
the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain
idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store
of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during
the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend
on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax
by largely saving honey, and the time consumed in collecting the
honey, must be an important element of success any family of bees.
Of course the success of the species may be dependent on the number
of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite distinct causes, and so
be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees
can collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance
determined, as it probably often has determined, whether a bee
allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any
country; and let us further suppose that the community lived
through the winter, and consequently required a store of honey:
there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to
our imaginary humble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts
led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a
little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save
some little labour and wax. Hence, it would continually be more and
more advantageous to our humble-bees, if they were to make their
cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a
mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part
of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound the
adjoining cells, and much labour and wax would be saved. Again,
from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if
she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in
every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical
surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane surfaces;
and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the
hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural
selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as
we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and
wax.</p>
<p>Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts,
that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having
taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of
simpler instincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more
and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given
distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and
excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. The bees, of
course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one
particular distance from each other, than they know what are the
several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic
plates; the motive power of the process of natural selection having
been the construction of cells of due strength and of the proper
size and shape for the larvae, this being effected with the
greatest possible economy of labour and wax; that individual swarm
which thus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste
of honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having
transmitted their newly-acquired economical instincts to new
swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of
succeeding in the struggle for existence.</p>
