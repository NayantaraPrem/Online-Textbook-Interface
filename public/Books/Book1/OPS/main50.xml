<div class="text">

Absence or rarity of transitional varieties — Transitions in habits
of life — Diversified habits in the same species — Species with
habits widely different from those of their allies — Organs of
extreme perfection — Modes of transition — Cases of difficulty —
Natura non facit saltum — Organs of small importance — Organs not
in all cases absolutely perfect — The law of Unity of Type and of
the Conditions of Existence embraced by the theory of Natural
Selection.</p>
