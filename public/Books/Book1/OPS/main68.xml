<h3 class="section_title">7. Objections To The Theory Of Natural
Selection As Applied To Instincts: Neuter And Sterile Insects</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of
instincts that "the variations of structure and of instinct must
have been simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a
modification in the one without an immediate corresponding change
in the other would have been fatal." The force of this objection
rests entirely on the assumption that the changes in the instincts
and structure are abrupt. To take as an illustration the case of
the larger titmouse, (Parus major) alluded to in a previous
chapter; this bird often holds the seeds of the yew between its
feet on a branch, and hammers with its beak till it gets at the
kernel. Now what special difficulty would there be in natural
selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the
shape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break
open the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for
this purpose as that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit,
or compulsion, or spontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to
become more and more of a seed-eater? In this case the beak is
supposed to be slowly modified by natural selection, subsequently
to, but in accordance with, slowly changing habits or taste; but
let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow larger from correlation
with the beak, or from any other unknown cause, and it is not
improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to climb more
and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct and
power of the nuthatch. In this case a gradual change of structure
is supposed to lead to changed instinctive habits. To take one more
case: few instincts are more remarkable than that which leads the
swift of the Eastern Islands to make its nest wholly of inspissated
saliva. Some birds build their nests of mud, believed to be
moistened with saliva; and one of the swifts of North America makes
its nest (as I have seen) of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and
even with flakes of this substance. Is it then very improbable that
the natural selection of individual swifts, which secreted more and
more saliva, should at last produce a species with instincts
leading it to neglect other materials and to make its nest
exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other cases. It must,
however, be admitted that in many instances we cannot conjecture
whether it was instinct or structure which first varied.</p>
<p>No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be
opposed to the theory of natural selectionâ€”cases, in which we
cannot see how an instinct could have originated; cases, in which
no intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instincts
of such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been acted
on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the
same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot
account for their similarity by inheritance from a common
progenitor, and consequently must believe that they were
independently acquired through natural selection. I will not here
enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one
special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and
actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to the neuters or
sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters often
differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and
fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate
their kind.</p>
<p>The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I
will here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants.
How the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not
much greater than that of any other striking modification of
structure; for it can be shown that some insects and other
articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become
sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been
profitable to the community that a number should have been annually
born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no
especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural
selection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The
great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from
both the males and the fertile females in structure, as in the
shape of the thorax, and in being destitute of wings and sometimes
of eyes, and in instinct. As far as instinct alone is concerned,
the wonderful difference in this respect between the workers and
the perfect females would have been better exemplified by the
hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an
ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its
characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection;
namely, by individuals having been born with slight profitable
modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and that
these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards. But
with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its
parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have
transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or
instinct to its progeny. It may well be asked how it is possible to
reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?</p>
<p>First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances,
both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature,
of all sorts of differences of inherited structure which are
correlated with certain ages and with either sex. We have
differences correlated not only with one sex, but with that short
period when the reproductive system is active, as in the nuptial
plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon.
We have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of
cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male
sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than the oxen of
other breeds, relatively to the length of the horns in both the
bulls and cows of these same breeds. Hence, I can see no great
difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile
condition of certain members of insect communities; the difficulty
lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of
structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural
selection.</p>
<p>This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or,
as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may
be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may
thus gain the desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and
fat to be well marbled together. An animal thus characterized has
been slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with confidence to the
same stock and has succeeded. Such faith may be placed in the power
of selection that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with
extraordinarily long horns, could, it is probable, be formed by
carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched,
produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox would ever
have propagated its kind. Here is a better and real illustration:
According to M. Verlot, some varieties of the double annual stock,
from having been long and carefully selected to the right degree,
always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double and
quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and
fertile plants. These latter, by which alone the variety can be
propagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants,
and the double sterile plants with the neuters of the same
community. As with the varieties of the stock, so with social
insects, selection has been applied to the family, and not to the
individual, for the sake of gaining a serviceable end. Hence, we
may conclude that slight modifications of structure or of instinct,
correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the
community, have proved advantageous; consequently the fertile males
and females have flourished, and transmitted to their fertile
offspring a tendency to produce sterile members with the same
modifications. This process must have been repeated many times,
until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and
sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see
in many social insects.</p>
<p>But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty;
namely, the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only
from the fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes
to an almost incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or
even three castes. The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate
into each other, but are perfectly well defined; being as distinct
from each other as are any two species of the same genus, or rather
as any two genera of the same family. Thus, in Eciton, there are
working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts
extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste
alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of
which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers
of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of
another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which
secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by
the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which
our European ants guard and imprison.</p>
<p>It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence
in the principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that
such wonderful and well-established facts at once annihilate the
theory. In the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste,
which, as I believe, have been rendered different from the fertile
males and females through natural selection, we may conclude from
the analogy of ordinary variations, that the successive, slight,
profitable modifications did not first arise in all the neuters in
the same nest, but in some few alone; and that by the survival of
the communities with females which produced most neuters having the
advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to be
thus characterized. According to this view we ought occasionally to
find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of
structure; and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how
few neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr.
F. Smith has shown that the neuters of several British ants differ
surprisingly from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and
that the extreme forms can be linked together by individuals taken
out of the same nest: I have myself compared perfect gradations of
this kind. It sometimes happens that the larger or the smaller
sized workers are the most numerous; or that both large and small
are numerous, while those of an intermediate size are scanty in
numbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some
few of intermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has
observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which,
though small, can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller
workers have their ocelli rudimentary. Having carefully dissected
several specimens of these workers, I can affirm that the eyes are
far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted
for merely by their proportionately lesser size; and I fully
believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers
of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate
condition. So that here we have two bodies of sterile workers in
the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of
vision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate
condition. I may digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had
been the most useful to the community, and those males and females
had been continually selected, which produced more and more of the
smaller workers, until all the workers were in this condition; we
should then have had a species of ant with neuters in nearly the
same condition as those of Myrmica. For the workers of Myrmica have
not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female ants of
this genus have well-developed ocelli.</p>
<p>I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect
occasionally to find gradations of important structures between the
different castes of neuters in the same species, that I gladly
availed myself of Mr. F. Smith's offer of numerous specimens from
the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader
will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these
workers by my giving, not the actual measurements, but a strictly
accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were to
see a set of workmen building a house, of whom many were five feet
four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must in
addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of
three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly
five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the
several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and
number of the teeth. But the important fact for us is that, though
the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they
graduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different
structure of their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point,
as Sir J. Lubbock made drawings for me, with the camera lucida, of
the jaws which I dissected from the workers of the several sizes.
Mr. Bates, in his interesting "Naturalist on the Amazons," has
described analogous cases.</p>
<p>With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by
acting on the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which
should regularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form
of jaw, or all of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly,
and this is the greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size
and structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a
different size and structure; a graduated series having first been
formed, as in the case of the driver ant, and then the extreme
forms having been produced in greater and greater numbers, through
the survival of the parents which generated them, until none with
an intermediate structure were produced.</p>
<p>An analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the
equally complex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly
appearing under two or even three distinct female forms; and by
Fritz Muller, of certain Brazilian crustaceans likewise appearing
under two widely distinct male forms. But this subject need not
here be discussed.</p>
<p>I have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two
distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same
nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents,
has originated. We can see how useful their production may have
been to a social community of ants, on the same principle that the
division of labour is useful to civilised man. Ants, however, work
by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man
works by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments. But I
must confess, that, with all my faith in natural selection, I
should never have anticipated that this principle could have been
efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neuter
insects led me to this conclusion. I have, therefore, discussed
this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in order
to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this
is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has
encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that
with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification may be
effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous
variations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or
habit having been brought into play. For peculiar habits, confined
to the workers of sterile females, however long they might be
followed, could not possibly affect the males and fertile females,
which alone leave descendants. I am surprised that no one has
advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the
well-known doctrine of inherited habit, as advanced by Lamarck.</p>
