<h3 class="section_title">5. On The State Of Development Of Ancient
Compared With Living Forms</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of
differentiation and specialisation of the parts in organic beings,
when arrived at maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested,
of their degree of perfection or highness. We have also seen that,
as the specialisation of parts is an advantage to each being, so
natural selection will tend to render the organisation of each
being more specialised and perfect, and in this sense higher; not
but that it may leave many creatures with simple and unimproved
structures fitted for simple conditions of life, and in some cases
will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet leaving such
degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life. In
another and more general manner, new species become superior to
their predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life
all the older forms, with which they come into close competition.
We may therefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate
the eocene inhabitants of the world could be put into competition
with the existing inhabitants, the former would be beaten and
exterminated by the latter, as would the secondary by the eocene,
and the palaeozoic by the secondary forms. So that by this
fundamental test of victory in the battle for life, as well as by
the standard of the specialisation of organs, modern forms ought,
on the theory of natural selection, to stand higher than ancient
forms. Is this the case? A large majority of palaeontologists would
answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this answer must be
admitted as true, though difficult of proof.</p>
<p>It is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain
Brachiopods have been but slightly modified from an extremely
remote geological epoch; and that certain land and fresh-water
shells have remained nearly the same, from the time when, as far as
is known, they first appeared. It is not an insuperable difficulty
that Foraminifera have not, as insisted on by Dr. Carpenter,
progressed in organisation since even the Laurentian epoch; for
some organisms would have to remain fitted for simple conditions of
life, and what could be better fitted for this end than these lowly
organised Protozoa? Such objections as the above would be fatal to
my view, if it included advance in organisation as a necessary
contingent. They would likewise be fatal, if the above
Foraminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first come into
existence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above Brachiopods
during the Cambrian formation; for in this case, there would not
have been time sufficient for the development of these organisms up
to the standard which they had then reached. When advanced up to
any given point, there is no necessity, on the theory of natural
selection, for their further continued process; though they will,
during each successive age, have to be slightly modified, so as to
hold their places in relation to slight changes in their
conditions. The foregoing objections hinge on the question whether
we really know how old the world is, and at what period the various
forms of life first appeared; and this may well be disputed.</p>
<p>The problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in
many ways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all
times imperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with
unmistakable clearness that within the known history of the world
organisation has largely advanced. Even at the present day, looking
to members of the same class, naturalists are not unanimous which
forms ought to be ranked as highest: thus, some look at the
selaceans or sharks, from their approach in some important points
of structure to reptiles, as the highest fish; others look at the
teleosteans as the highest. The ganoids stand intermediate between
the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter at the present day are
largely preponderant in number; but formerly selaceans and ganoids
alone existed; and in this case, according to the standard of
highness chosen, so will it be said that fishes have advanced or
retrograded in organisation. To attempt to compare members of
distinct types in the scale of highness seems hopeless; who will
decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a bee—that insect which
the great Von Baer believed to be "in fact more highly organised
than a fish, although upon another type?" In the complex struggle
for life it is quite credible that crustaceans, not very high in
their own class, might beat cephalopods, the highest molluscs; and
such crustaceans, though not highly developed, would stand very
high in the scale of invertebrate animals, if judged by the most
decisive of all trials—the law of battle. Beside these inherent
difficulties in deciding which forms are the most advanced in
organisation, we ought not solely to compare the highest members of
a class at any two periods—though undoubtedly this is one and
perhaps the most important element in striking a balance—but we
ought to compare all the members, high and low, at two periods. At
an ancient epoch the highest and lowest molluscoidal animals,
namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in numbers; at the
present time both groups are greatly reduced, while others,
intermediate in organisation, have largely increased; consequently
some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more highly
developed than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on
the opposite side, by considering the vast reduction of
brachiopods, and the fact that our existing cephalopods, though few
in number, are more highly organised than their ancient
representatives. We ought also to compare the relative proportional
numbers, at any two periods, of the high and low classes throughout
the world: if, for instance, at the present day fifty thousand
kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if we knew that at some
former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we ought to look at
this increase in number in the highest class, which implies a great
displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the
organisation of the world. We thus see how hopelessly difficult it
is to compare with perfect fairness, under such extremely complex
relations, the standard of organisation of the imperfectly-known
faunas of successive periods.</p>
<p>We shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to
certain existing faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner
in which European productions have recently spread over New
Zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously
occupied by the indigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals
and plants of Great Britain were set free in New Zealand, a
multitude of British forms would in the course of time become
thoroughly naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the
natives. On the other hand, from the fact that hardly a single
inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become wild in any part
of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the productions of New
Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any considerable number
would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native
plants and animals. Under this point of view, the productions of
Great Britain stand much higher in the scale than those of New
Zealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist, from an examination of
the species of the two countries, could not have foreseen this
result.</p>
<p>Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that
ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent
animals belonging to the same classes; and that the geological
succession of extinct forms is nearly parallel with the
embryological development of existing forms. This view accords
admirably well with our theory. In a future chapter I shall attempt
to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing to variations
having supervened at a not early age, and having been inherited at
a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo
almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive
generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo
comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the
former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be
true, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance,
that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong
to their proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a
slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical
members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to
look for animals having the common embryological character of the
Vertebrata, until beds rich in fossils are discovered far beneath
the lowest Cambrian strata—a discovery of which the chance is
small.</p>
