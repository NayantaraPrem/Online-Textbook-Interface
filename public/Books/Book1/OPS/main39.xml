<p>I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common
and multiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a
lesser degree with those under nature—were due to chance. This, of
course is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to
acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular
variation. Some authors believe it to be as much the function of
the reproductive system to produce individual differences, or
slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its
parents. But the fact of variations and monstrosities occurring
much more frequently under domestication than under nature, and the
greater variability of species having wide ranges than of those
with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that variability is
generally related to the conditions of life to which each species
has been exposed during several successive generations. In the
first chapter I attempted to show that changed conditions act in
two ways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts
alone, and indirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases
there are two factors, the nature of the organism, which is much
the most important of the two, and the nature of the conditions.
The direct action of changed conditions leads to definite or
indefinite results. In the latter case the organisation seems to
become plastic, and we have much fluctuating variability. In the
former case the nature of the organism is such that it yields
readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all, or nearly
all, the individuals become modified in the same way.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such
as of climate, food, etc., have acted in a definite manner. There
is reason to believe that in the course of time the effects have
been greater than can be proved by clear evidence. But we may
safely conclude that the innumerable complex co-adaptations of
structure, which we see throughout nature between various organic
beings, cannot be attributed simply to such action. In the
following cases the conditions seem to have produced some slight
definite effect: E. Forbes asserts that shells at their southern
limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly coloured
than those of the same species from further north or from a greater
depth; but this certainly does not always hold good. Mr. Gould
believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured
under a clear atmosphere, than when living near the coast or on
islands; and Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea
affects the colours of insects. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of
plants which, when growing near the sea-shore, have their leaves in
some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. These slightly
varying organisms are interesting in as far as they present
characters analogous to those possessed by the species which are
confined to similar conditions.</p>
<p>When a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot
tell how much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural
selection, and how much to the definite action of the conditions of
life. Thus, it is well known to furriers that animals of the same
species have thicker and better fur the further north they live;
but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the
warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during
many generations, and how much to the action of the severe climate?
For it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair
of our domestic quadrupeds.</p>
<p>Instances could be given of similar varieties being produced
from the same species under external conditions of life as
different as can well be conceived; and, on the other hand, of
dissimilar varieties being produced under apparently the same
external conditions. Again, innumerable instances are known to
every naturalist, of species keeping true, or not varying at all,
although living under the most opposite climates. Such
considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on the direct
action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to vary,
due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.</p>
<p>In one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to
cause variability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to
include natural selection, for the conditions determine whether
this or that variety shall survive. But when man is the selecting
agent, we clearly see that the two elements of change are distinct;
variability is in some manner excited, but it is the will of man
which accumulates the variations in certain direction; and it is
this latter agency which answers to the survival of the fittest
under nature.</p>
