Chapters</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>In these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due
allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of
climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred
within the recent period, and of other changes which have probably
occurred—if we remember how ignorant we are with respect to the
many curious means of occasional transport—if we bear in mind, and
this is a very important consideration, how often a species may
have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become
extinct in the intermediate tracts—the difficulty is not
insuperable in believing that all the individuals of the same
species, wherever found, are descended from common parents. And we
are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many
naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by
various general considerations, more especially from the importance
of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of
subgenera, genera, and families.</p>
<p>With respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus,
which on our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make
the same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that
some forms of life have changed very slowly, enormous periods of
time having been thus granted for their migration, the difficulties
are far from insuperable; though in this case, as in that of the
individuals of the same species, they are often great.</p>
<p>As exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on
distribution, I have attempted to show how important a part the
last Glacial period has played, which affected even the equatorial
regions, and which, during the alternations of the cold in the
north and the south, allowed the productions of opposite
hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them stranded on the
mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As showing how
diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed
at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water
productions.</p>
<p>If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the
long course of time all the individuals of the same species, and
likewise of the several species belonging to the same genus, have
proceeded from some one source; then all the grand leading facts of
geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of
migration, together with subsequent modification and the
multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high
importance of barriers, whether of land or water, in not only
separating but in apparently forming the several zoological and
botanical provinces. We can thus understand the concentration of
related species within the same areas; and how it is that under
different latitudes, for instance, in South America, the
inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes,
and deserts, are linked together in so mysterious a manner, and are
likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the
same continent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relation of
organism to organism is of the highest importance, we can see why
two areas, having nearly the same physical conditions, should often
be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the
length of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one of
the regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication
which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in
greater or lesser numbers; according or not as those which entered
happened to come into more or less direct competition with each
other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were
capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in the
to or more regions, independently of their physical conditions,
infinitely diversified conditions of life; there would be an almost
endless amount of organic action and reaction, and we should find
some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified;
some developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers—and
this we do find in the several great geographical provinces of the
world.</p>
<p>On these same principles we can understand, as I have
endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few
inhabitants, but that of these, a large proportion should be
endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of
migration, one group of beings should have all its species
peculiar, and another group, even within the same class, should
have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter of
the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians
and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands,
whilst the most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar
species of aerial mammals or bats. We can see why, in islands,
there should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a
more or less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between
such islands and the mainland. We can clearly see why all the
inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on the
several islets, should be closely related to each other, and should
likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the nearest
continent, or other source whence immigrants might have been
derived. We can see why, if there exist very closely allied or
representative species in two areas, however distant from each
other, some identical species will almost always there be
found.</p>
<p>As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking
parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws
governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the
same with those governing at the present time the differences in
different areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each
species and group of species is continuous in time; for the
apparent exceptions to the rule are so few that they may fairly be
attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate
deposit certain forms which are absent in it, but which occur above
and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the
area inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is
continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as I have
attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations under
different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport,
or by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts.
Both in time and space species and groups of species have their
points of maximum development. Groups of species, living during the
same period of time, or living within the same area, are often
characterised by trifling features in common, as of sculpture or
colour. In looking to the long succession of past ages, as in
looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that
species in certain classes differ little from each other, whilst
those in another class, or only in a different section of the same
order, differ greatly from each other. In both time and space the
lowly organised members of each class generally change less than
the highly organised; but there are in both cases marked exceptions
to the rule. According to our theory, these several relations
throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to
the allied forms of life which have changed during successive ages,
or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant
quarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond of
ordinary generation; in both cases the laws of variation have been
the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same means
of natural selection.</p>
