<h3 class="section_title">2. Single Centres Of Supposed
Creation</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We are thus brought to the question which has been largely
discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been created
at one or more points of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly there are
many cases of extreme difficulty in understanding how the same
species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the
several distant and isolated points, where now found. Nevertheless
the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced
within a single region captivates the mind. He who rejects it,
rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent
migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is universally
admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is
continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two points so
distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that
the space could not have been easily passed over by migration, the
fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional. The
incapacity of migrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case
of terrestrial mammals than perhaps with any other organic beings;
and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable instances of the same
mammals inhabiting distant points of the world. No geologist feels
any difficulty in Great Britain possessing the same quadrupeds with
the rest of Europe, for they were no doubt once united. But if the
same species can be produced at two separate points, why do we not
find a single mammal common to Europe and Australia or South
America? The conditions of life are nearly the same, so that a
multitude of European animals and plants have become naturalised in
America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants are
identically the same at these distant points of the northern and
southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals
have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their
varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broken
interspaces. The great and striking influence of barriers of all
kinds, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of
species have been produced on one side, and have not been able to
migrate to the opposite side. Some few families, many subfamilies,
very many genera, a still greater number of sections of genera, are
confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several
naturalists that the most natural genera, or those genera in which
the species are most closely related to each other, are generally
confined to the same country, or if they have a wide range that
their range is continuous. What a strange anomaly it would be if a
directly opposite rule were to prevail when we go down one step
lower in the series, namely to the individuals of the same species,
and these had not been, at least at first, confined to some one
region!</p>
<p>Hence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that
the view of each species having been produced in one area alone,
and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its
powers of migration and subsistence under past and present
conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases
occur in which we cannot explain how the same species could have
passed from one point to the other. But the geographical and
climatical changes which have certainly occurred within recent
geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerly
continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to
consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so
numerous, and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the
belief, rendered probable by general considerations, that each
species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence
as far as it could. It would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all
the exceptional cases of the same species, now living at distant
and separated points; nor do I for a moment pretend that any
explanation could be offered of many instances. But, after some
preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking
classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species on the
summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the
Arctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following
chapter), the wide distribution of fresh water productions; and
thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands
and on the nearest mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles
of open sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and
isolated points of the earth's surface can in many instances be
explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single
birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect to former
climatical and geographical changes, and to the various occasional
means of transport, the belief that a single birthplace is the law
seems to me incomparably the safest.</p>
<p>In discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time
to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the
several species of a genus which must on our theory all be
descended from a common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing
modification during their migration from some one area. If, when
most of the species inhabiting one region are different from those
of another region, though closely allied to them, it can be shown
that migration from the one region to the other has probably
occurred at some former period, our general view will be much
strengthened; for the explanation is obvious on the principle of
descent with modification. A volcanic island, for instance,
upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from
a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a
few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still
be related by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent.
Cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter
see, inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This view
of the relation of the species of one region to those of another,
does not differ much from that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who
concludes that "every species has come into existence coincident
both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species."
And it is now well known that he attributes this coincidence to
descent with modification.</p>
<p>The question of single or multiple centres of creation differs
from another though allied question, namely, whether all the
individuals of the same species are descended from a single pair,
or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from
many individuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which
never intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended
from a succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each
other, but have never blended with other individuals or varieties
of the same species, so that, at each successive stage of
modification, all the individuals of the same form will be
descended from a single parent. But in the great majority of cases,
namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth,
or which occasionally intercross, the individuals of the same
species inhabiting the same area will be kept nearly uniform by
intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on simultaneously
changing, and the whole amount of modification at each stage will
not be due to descent from a single parent. To illustrate what I
mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every other
breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to
descent from any single pair, but to continued care in the
selecting and training of many individuals during each
generation.</p>
<p>Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have
selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the
theory of "single centres of creation," I must say a few words on
the means of dispersal.</p>
