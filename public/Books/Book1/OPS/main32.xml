<h3 class="section_title">6. Extinction Caused By Natural
Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on
Geology; but it must here be alluded to from being intimately
connected with natural selection. Natural selection acts solely
through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous,
which consequently endure. Owing to the high geometrical rate of
increase of all organic beings, each area is already fully stocked
with inhabitants, and it follows from this, that as the favoured
forms increase in number, so, generally, will the less favoured
decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is the
precursor to extinction. We can see that any form which is
represented by few individuals will run a good chance of utter
extinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the seasons,
or from a temporary increase in the number of its enemies. But we
may go further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we
admit that specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in
number, many old forms must become extinct. That the number of
specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology plainly
tells us; and we shall presently attempt to show why it is that the
number of species throughout the world has not become immeasurably
great.</p>
<p>We have seen that the species which are most numerous in
individuals have the best chance of producing favourable variations
within any given period. We have evidence of this, in the facts
stated in the second chapter, showing that it is the common and
diffused or dominant species which offer the greatest number of
recorded varieties. Hence, rare species will be less quickly
modified or improved within any given period; they will
consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified and
improved descendants of the commoner species.</p>
<p>From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,
that as new species in the course of time are formed through
natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally
extinct. The forms which stand in closest competition with those
undergoing modification and improvement, will naturally suffer
most. And we have seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence
that it is the most closely-allied forms,—varieties of the same
species, and species of the same genus or related genera,—which,
from having nearly the same structure, constitution and habits,
generally come into the severest competition with each other.
Consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress of
its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred,
and tend to exterminate them. We see the same process of
extermination among our domesticated productions, through the
selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be
given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other
animals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and
inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the
ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that
these "were swept away by the short-horns" (I quote the words of an
agricultural writer) "as if by some murderous pestilence."</p>
