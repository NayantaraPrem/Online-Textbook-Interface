<div class="text">
<p>The action of the Royal Society at its meeting in London on
November 6, in recognizing Dr. Albert Einstein's “theory of
relativity” has caused a great stir in scientific circles on both
sides of the Atlantic. Dr. Einstein propounded his theory nearly
fifteen years ago. The present revival of interest in it is due to
the remarkable confirmation which it received in the report of the
observations made during the sun's eclipse of last May to determine
whether rays of light passing close to the sun are deflected from
their course.</p>
<p>The actual deflection of the rays that was discovered by the
astronomers was precisely what had been predicted theoretically by
Einstein many years since. This striking confirmation has led
certain German scientists to assert that no scientific discovery of
such importance has been made since Newton's theory of gravitation
was promulgated. This suggestion, however, was put aside by Dr.
Einstein himself when he was interviewed by a correspondent of the
New York&#160;<em>Times</em>&#160;at his home in Berlin. To this
correspondent he expressed the difference between his conception
and the law of gravitation in the following terms:</p>
<p>“Please imagine the earth removed, and in its place suspended a
box as big as a room or a whole house, and inside a man naturally
floating in the center, there being no force whatever pulling him.
Imagine, further, this box being, by a rope or other contrivance,
suddenly jerked to one side, which is scientifically termed
‘difform motion’, as opposed to ‘uniform motion.’ The person would
then naturally reach bottom on the opposite side. The result would
consequently be the same as if he obeyed Newton's law of
gravitation, while, in fact, there is no gravitation exerted
whatever, which proves that difform motion will in every case
produce the same effects as gravitation.</p>
<p>“I have applied this new idea to every kind of difform motion
and have thus developed mathematical formulas which I am convinced
give more precise results than those based on Newton's theory.
Newton's formulas, however, are such close approximations that it
was difficult to find by observation any obvious disagreement with
experience.”</p>
<p>Dr. Einstein, it must be remembered, is a physicist and not an
astronomer. He developed his theory as a mathematical formula. The
confirmation of it came from the astronomers. As he himself says,
the crucial test was supplied by the last total solar eclipse.
Observations then proved that the rays of fixed stars, having to
pass close to the sun to reach the earth, were deflected the exact
amount demanded by Einstein's formulas. The deflection was also in
the direction predicted by him.</p>
<p>The question must have occurred to many, what has all this to do
with relativity? When this query was propounded by
the&#160;<em>Times</em>&#160;correspondent to Dr. Einstein he
replied as follows:</p>
<p>“The term relativity refers to time and space. According to
Galileo and Newton, time and space were absolute entities, and the
moving systems of the universe were dependent on this absolute time
and space. On this conception was built the science of mechanics.
The resulting formulas sufficed for all motions of a slow nature;
it was found, however, that they would not conform to the rapid
motions apparent in electrodynamics.</p>
<p>“This led the Dutch professor, Lorentz, and myself to develop
the theory of special relativity. Briefly, it discards absolute
time and space and makes them in every instance relative to moving
systems. By this theory all phenomena in electrodynamics, as well
as mechanics, hitherto irreducible by the old formulae—and there
are multitudes—were satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>“Till now it was believed that time and space existed by
themselves, even if there was nothing else—no sun, no earth, no
stars—while now we know that time and space are not the vessel for
the universe, but could not exist at all if there were no contents,
namely, no sun, earth and other celestial bodies.</p>
<p>“This special relativity, forming the first part of my theory,
relates to all systems moving with uniform motion; that is, moving
in a straight line with equal velocity.</p>
<p>“Gradually I was led to the idea, seeming a very paradox in
science, that it might apply equally to all moving systems, even of
difform motion, and thus I developed the conception of general
relativity which forms the second part of my theory.”</p>
<p>As summarized by an American astronomer, Professor Henry Norris
Russell, of Princeton, in the&#160;<em>Scientific
American</em>&#160;for November 29, Einstein's contribution amounts
to this:</p>
<p>“The central fact which has been proved—and which is of great
interest and importance—is that the natural phenomena involving
gravitation and inertia (such as the motions of the planets) and
the phenomena involving electricity and magnetism (including the
motion of light) are not independent of one another, but are
intimately related, so that both sets of phenomena should be
regarded as parts of one vast system, embracing all Nature. The
relation of the two is, however, of such a character that it is
perceptible only in a very few instances, and then only to refined
observations.”</p>
<p>Already before the war, Einstein had immense fame among
physicists, and among all who are interested in the philosophy of
science, because of his principle of relativity.</p>
<p>Clerk Maxwell had shown that light is electro-magnetic, and had
reduced the whole theory of electro-magnetism to a small number of
equations, which are fundamental in all subsequent work. But these
equations were entangled with the hypothesis of the ether, and with
the notion of motion relative to the ether. Since the ether was
supposed to be at rest, such motion was indistinguishable from
absolute motion. The motion of the earth relatively to the ether
should have been different at different points of its orbit, and
measurable phenomena should have resulted from this difference. But
none did, and all attempts to detect effects of motions relative to
the ether failed. The theory of relativity succeeded in accounting
for this fact. But it was necessary incidentally to throw over the
one universal time, and substitute local times attached to moving
bodies and varying according to their motion. The equations on
which the theory of relativity is based are due to Lorentz, but
Einstein connected them with his general principle, namely, that
there must be nothing, in observable phenomena, which could be
attributed to absolute motion of the observer.</p>
<p>In orthodox Newtonian dynamics the principle of relativity had a
simpler form, which did not require the substitution of local time
for general time. But it now appeared that Newtonian dynamics is
only valid when we confine ourselves to velocities much less than
that of light. The whole Galileo-Newton system thus sank to the
level of a first approximation, becoming progressively less exact
as the velocities concerned approached that of light.</p>
<p>Einstein's extension of his principle so as to account for
gravitation was made during the war, and for a considerable period
our astronomers were unable to become acquainted with it, owing to
the difficulty of obtaining German printed matter. However, copies
of his work ultimately reached the outside world and enabled people
to learn more about it. Gravitation, ever since Newton, had
remained isolated from other forces in nature; various attempts had
been made to account for it, but without success. The immense
unification effected by electro-magnetism apparently left
gravitation out of its scope. It seemed that nature had presented a
challenge to the physicists which none of them were able to
meet.</p>
<p>At this point Einstein intervened with a hypothesis which, apart
altogether from subsequent verification, deserves to rank as one of
the great monuments of human genius. After correcting Newton, it
remained to correct Euclid, and it was in terms of non-Euclidean
geometry that he stated his new theory. Non-Euclidean geometry is a
study of which the primary motive was logical and philosophical;
few of its promoters ever dreamed that it would come to be applied
in physics. Some of Euclid's axioms were felt to be not “necessary
truths,” but mere empirical laws; in order to establish this view,
self-consistent geometries were constructed upon assumptions other
than those of Euclid. In these geometries the sum of the angles of
a triangle is not two right angles, and the departure from two
right angles increases as the size of the triangle increases. It is
often said that in non-Euclidean geometry space has a curvature,
but this way of stating the matter is misleading, since it seems to
imply a fourth dimension, which is not implied by these
systems.</p>
<p>Einstein supposes that space is Euclidean where it is
sufficiently remote from matter, but that the presence of matter
causes it to become slightly non-Euclidean—the more matter there is
in the neighborhood, the more space will depart from Euclid. By the
help of this hypothesis, together with his previous theory of
relativity, he deduces gravitation—very approximately, but not
exactly, according to the Newtonian law of the inverse square. The
minute differences between the effects deduced from his theory and
those deduced from Newton are measurable in certain cases. There
are, so far, three crucial tests of the relative accuracy of the
new theory and the old.</p>
<p>(1) The perihelion of Mercury shows a discrepancy which has long
puzzled astronomers. This discrepancy is fully accounted for by
Einstein. At the time when he published his theory, this was its
only experimental verification.</p>
<p>(2) Modern physicists were willing to suppose that light might
be subject to gravitation—i.e., that a ray of light passing near a
great mass like the sun might be deflected to the extent to which a
particle moving with the same velocity would be deflected according
to the orthodox theory of gravitation. But Einstein's theory
required that the light should be deflected just twice as much as
this. The matter could only be tested during an eclipse among a
number of bright stars. Fortunately a peculiarly favourable eclipse
occurred last year. The results of the observations have now been
published, and are found to verify Einstein's prediction. The
verification is not, of course, quite exact; with such delicate
observations that was not to be expected. In some cases the
departure is considerable. But taking the average of the best
series of observations, the deflection at the sun's limb is found
to be 1.98″, with a probable error of about 6 per cent., whereas
the deflection calculated by Einstein's theory should be 1.75″. It
will be noticed that Einstein's theory gave a deflection twice as
large as that predicted by the orthodox theory, and that the
observed deflection is slightly&#160;<em>larger</em>&#160;than
Einstein predicted. The discrepancy is well within what might be
expected in view of the minuteness of the measurements. It is
therefore generally acknowledged by astronomers that the outcome is
a triumph for Einstein.</p>
<p>(3) In the excitement of this sensational verification, there
has been a tendency to overlook the third experimental test to
which Einstein's theory was to be subjected. If his theory is
correct as it stands, there ought, in a gravitational field, to be
a displacement of the lines of the spectrum towards the red. No
such effect has been discovered. Spectroscopists maintain that, so
far as can be seen at present, there is no way of accounting for
this failure if Einstein's theory in its present form is assumed.
They admit that some compensating cause&#160;<em>may</em>&#160;be
discovered to explain the discrepancy, but they think it far more
probable that Einstein's theory requires some essential
modification. Meanwhile, a certain suspense of judgment is called
for. The new law has been so amazingly successful in two of the
three tests that there must be some thing valid about it, even if
it is not exactly right as yet.</p>
<p>Einstein's theory has the very highest degree of aesthetic
merit: every lover of the beautiful must wish it to be true. It
gives a vast unified survey of the operations of nature, with a
technical simplicity in the critical assumptions which makes the
wealth of deductions astonishing. It is a case of an advance
arrived at by pure theory: the whole effect of Einstein's work is
to make physics more philosophical (in a good sense), and to
restore some of that intellectual unity which belonged to the great
scientific systems of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but
which was lost through increasing specialization and the
overwhelming mass of detailed knowledge. In some ways our age is
not a good one to live in, but for those who are interested in
physics there are great compensations.</p>
