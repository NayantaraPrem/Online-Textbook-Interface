<h3 class="section_title">5. Principles Of Selection Anciently
Followed, And Their Effects</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races
have been produced, either from one or from several allied species.
Some effect may be attributed to the direct and definite action of
the external conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be
a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences
between a dray and race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a
carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in
our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not
indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or
fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly,
or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the
fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by any
mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and
this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it
has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have
been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the
dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various
breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain
pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that
of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many
breeds of dogs, each good for man in different ways; when we
compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds
so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting layers" which never desire
to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare
the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden
races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for
different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think,
look further than to mere variability. We can not suppose that all
the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we
now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been
their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection:
nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain
directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made
for himself useful breeds.</p>
<p>The great power of this principle of selection is not
hypothetical. It is certain that several of our eminent breeders
have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent
their breeds of cattle and sheep. In order fully to realise what
they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many
treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals.
Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something
plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I had space
I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly
competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted
with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other
individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals,
speaks of the principle of selection as "that which enables the
agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but
to change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of
which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases."
Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep,
says: "It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form
perfect in itself, and then had given it existence." In Saxony the
importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep
is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep
are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a
connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and
the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best
may ultimately be selected for breeding.</p>
<p>What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the
enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these
have been exported to almost every quarter of the world. The
improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different
breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this
practice, except sometimes among closely allied sub-breeds. And
when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more
indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection consisted
merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from
it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice;
but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the
accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of
differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated
eye—differences which I for one have vainly attempted to
appreciate. Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and
judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with
these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes
his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed,
and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these
qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the
natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a
skilful pigeon-fancier.</p>
<p>The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the
variations are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our
choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from
the aboriginal stock. We have proofs that this is not so in several
cases in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very
trifling instance, the steadily increasing size of the common
gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement in many
florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared
with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of
plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not
pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and
pull up the "rogues," as they call the plants that deviate from the
proper standard. With animals this kind of selection is, in fact,
likewise followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to breed
from his worst animals.</p>
<p>In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the
accumulated effects of selection—namely, by comparing the diversity
of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the
flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or
whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with
the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of
the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and
flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different the leaves
of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike
the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how
much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in
size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present
very slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ
largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points;
this is hardly ever—I speak after careful observation—perhaps
never, the case. The law of correlated variation, the importance of
which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences;
but, as a general rule, it cannot be doubted that the continued
selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers,
or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly
in these characters.</p>
<p>It may be objected that the principle of selection has been
reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than
three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to
of late years, and many treatises have been published on the
subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid
and important. But it is very far from true that the principle is a
modern discovery. I could give several references to works of high
antiquity, in which the full importance of the principle is
acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English history
choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent
their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size
was ordered, and this may be compared to the "roguing" of plants by
nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in
an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by
some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it
is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early
period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with
wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did
so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South
Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the
Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone states that good
domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the interior of
Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts
do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of
domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is
now attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been
a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the
inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.</p>
