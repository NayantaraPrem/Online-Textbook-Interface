<h3 class="section_title">2. The Term, Struggle For Existence, Used
In A Large Sense</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I should premise that I use this term in a large and
metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another,
and including (which is more important) not only the life of the
individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in
a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other
which shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert
is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more
properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant
which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which only one of an
average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with
the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the
ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other
trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with
these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same
tree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling mistletoes,
growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said
to struggle with each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated by
birds, its existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be
said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the
birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds. In these several
senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the
general term of Struggle for Existence.</p>
