<h3 class="section_title">5. Reciprocal Dimorphism And
Trimorphism</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>This subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to
throw some light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct
orders present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and
which differ in no respect except in their reproductive organs; one
form having a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short
pistil with long stamens; the two having differently sized
pollen-grains. With trimorphic plants there are three forms
likewise differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, in
the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and in some other
respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two sets of
stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens and
three kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length
to each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a
level with the stigma of the third form. Now I have shown, and the
result has been confirmed by other observers, that in order to
obtain full fertility with these plants, it is necessary that the
stigma of the one form should be fertilised by pollen taken from
the stamens of corresponding height in another form. So that with
dimorphic species two unions, which may be called legitimate, are
fully fertile; and two, which may be called illegitimate, are more
or less infertile. With trimorphic species six unions are
legitimate, or fully fertile, and twelve are illegitimate, or more
or less infertile.</p>
<p>The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is
by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the
pistil, differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility;
just in the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As
the degree of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent
degree on the conditions of life being more or less favourable, so
I have found it with illegitimate unions. It is well known that if
pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower,
and its own pollen be afterwards, even after a considerable
interval of time, placed on the same stigma, its action is so
strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the effect of the
foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen of the several forms of
the same species, for legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over
illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the same stigma. I
ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first
illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with
pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the
seedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate
pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly
destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied
illegitimate pollen. Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between
the same two species, there is occasionally a great difference in
the result, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for
instance, the mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria was
illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the
longer stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many seeds;
but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by
the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.</p>
<p>In all these respects, and in others which might be added, the
forms of the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united,
behave in exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when
crossed. This led me carefully to observe during four years many
seedlings, raised from several illegitimate unions. The chief
result is that these illegitimate plants, as they may be called,
are not fully fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic
species, both long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and
from trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then
be properly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there
is no apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as
did their parents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the
case. They are all infertile, in various degrees; some being so
utterly and incurably sterile that they did not yield during four
seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule. The sterility of these
illegitimate plants, when united with each other in a legitimate
manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids when crossed
inter se. If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either
pure parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so
it is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate
plant. In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not
always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross
between the two parent-species, so that sterility of certain
illegitimate plants was unusually great, while the sterility of the
union from which they were derived was by no means great. With
hybrids raised from the same seed- capsule the degree of sterility
is innately variable, so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate
plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers,
while other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are
weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the
illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic
plants.</p>
<p>Altogether there is the closest identity in character and
behaviour between illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an
exaggeration to maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids,
produced within the limits of the same species by the improper
union of certain forms, while ordinary hybrids are produced from an
improper union between so-called distinct species. We have also
already seen that there is the closest similarity in all respects
between first illegitimate unions and first crosses between
distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by
an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two
well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of
the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by
crossing whether they were specifically distinct. He would find
that they yielded only about one-fifth of the proper number of
seed, and that they behaved in all the other above specified
respects as if they had been two distinct species. But to make the
case sure, he would raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed,
and he would find that the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and
utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all other respects like
ordinary hybrids. He might then maintain that he had actually
proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two varieties
were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but he
would be completely mistaken.</p>
<p>The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are
important, because they show us, first, that the physiological test
of lessened fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no
safe criterion of specific distinction; secondly, because we may
conclude that there is some unknown bond which connects the
infertility of illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate
offspring, and we are led to extend the same view to first crosses
and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and this seems to me of
especial importance, that two or three forms of the same species
may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in
structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions,
and yet be sterile when united in certain ways. For we must
remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals
of the same form, for instance, of two long- styled forms, which
results in sterility; while it is the union of the sexual elements
proper to two distinct forms which is fertile. Hence the case
appears at first sight exactly the reverse of what occurs, in the
ordinary unions of the individuals of the same species and with
crosses between distinct species. It is, however, doubtful whether
this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this obscure
subject.</p>
<p>We may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of
dimorphic and trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct
species when crossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends
exclusively on the nature of their sexual elements, and not on any
difference in their structure or general constitution. We are also
led to this same conclusion by considering reciprocal crosses, in
which the male of one species cannot be united, or can be united
with great difficulty, with the female of a second species, while
the converse cross can be effected with perfect facility. That
excellent observer, Gartner, likewise concluded that species when
crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their
reproductive systems.</p>
