<h3 class="section_title">5. Modes Of Transition</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed,
which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive,
slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I
can find out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we
do not know the transitional grades, more especially if we look to
much-isolated species, around which, according to the theory, there
has been much extinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to
all the members of a class, for in this latter case the organ must
have been originally formed at a remote period, since which all the
many members of the class have been developed; and in order to
discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has
passed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms,
long since become extinct.</p>
<p>We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ
could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind.
Numerous cases could be given among the lower animals of the same
organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus
in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the
alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the
animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then
digest and the stomach respire. In such cases natural selection
might specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, the whole or
part of an organ, which had previously performed two functions, for
one function alone, and thus by insensible steps greatly change its
nature. Many plants are known which regularly produce at the same
time differently constructed flowers; and if such plants were to
produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected with
comparative suddenness in the character of the species. It is,
however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same
plant were originally differentiated by finely graduated steps,
which may still be followed in some few cases.</p>
<p>Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very
different forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual
the same function, and this is an extremely important means of
transition: to give one instance—there are fish with gills or
branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same
time that they breathe free air in their swim-bladders, this latter
organ being divided by highly vascular partitions and having a
ductus pneumaticus for the supply of air. To give another instance
from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb by three distinct means,
by spirally twining, by clasping a support with their sensitive
tendrils, and by the emission of aerial rootlets; these three means
are usually found in distinct groups, but some few species exhibit
two of the means, or even all three, combined in the same
individual. In all such cases one of the two organs might readily
be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being
aided during the progress of modification by the other organ; and
then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite
distinct purpose, or be wholly obliterated.</p>
<p>The illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one,
because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ
originally constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be
converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely
respiration. The swim-bladder has, also, been worked in as an
accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All
physiologists admit that the swim-bladder is homologous, or
"ideally similar" in position and structure with the lungs of the
higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that
the swim- bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an
organ used exclusively for respiration.</p>
<p>According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate
animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from
an ancient and unknown prototype which was furnished with a
floating apparatus or swim-bladder. We can thus, as I infer from
Professor Owen's interesting description of these parts, understand
the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we
swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk
of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful
contrivance by which the glottis is closed. In the higher
Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly disappeared—but in the embryo
the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course of the
arteries still mark their former position. But it is conceivable
that the now utterly lost branchiae might have been gradually
worked in by natural selection for some distinct purpose: for
instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are developed
from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in this
great class organs which once served for respiration have been
actually converted into organs for flight.</p>
<p>In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear
in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another,
that I will give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two
minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which
serve, through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs
until they are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no
branchiae, the whole surface of the body and of the sack, together
with the small frena, serving for respiration. The Balanidae or
sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the
eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, within the
well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same relative position
with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which freely
communicate with the circulatory lacunae of the sack and body, and
which have been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiae.
Now I think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one
family are strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other
family; indeed, they graduate into each other. Therefore it need
not be doubted that the two little folds of skin, which originally
served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided
in the act of respiration, have been gradually converted by natural
selection into branchiae, simply through an increase in their size
and the obliteration of their adhesive glands. If all pedunculated
cirripedes had become extinct, and they have suffered far more
extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would ever have
imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had originally
existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of
the sack?</p>
<p>There is another possible mode of transition, namely, through
the acceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This
has lately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the
United States. It is now known that some animals are capable of
reproduction at a very early age, before they have acquired their
perfect characters; and if this power became thoroughly well
developed in a species, it seems probable that the adult stage of
development would sooner or later be lost; and in this case,
especially if the larva differed much from the mature form, the
character of the species would be greatly changed and degraded.
Again, not a few animals, after arriving at maturity, go on
changing in character during nearly their whole lives. With
mammals, for instance, the form of the skull is often much altered
with age, of which Dr. Murie has given some striking instances with
seals. Every one knows how the horns of stags become more and more
branched, and the plumes of some birds become more finely
developed, as they grow older. Professor Cope states that the teeth
of certain lizards change much in shape with advancing years. With
crustaceans not only many trivial, but some important parts assume
a new character, as recorded by Fritz Muller, after maturity. In
all such cases- -and many could be given—if the age for
reproduction were retarded, the character of the species, at least
in its adult state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that
the previous and earlier stages of development would in some cases
be hurried through and finally lost. Whether species have often or
ever been modified through this comparatively sudden mode of
transition, I can form no opinion; but if this has occurred, it is
probable that the differences between the young and the mature, and
between the mature and the old, were primordially acquired by
graduated steps.</p>
