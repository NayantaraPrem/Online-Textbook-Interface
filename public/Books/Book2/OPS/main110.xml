<h3 class="section_title">4. Morphology</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>We have seen that the members of the same class, independently
of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of
their organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term
"unity of type;" or by saying that the several parts and organs in
the different species of the class are homologous. The whole
subject is included under the general term of Morphology. This is
one of the most interesting departments of natural history, and may
almost be said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than
that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for
digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the
wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and
should include similar bones, in the same relative positions? How
curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking instance, that
the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted for
bounding over the open plains—those of the climbing, leaf-eating
koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees—those
of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots—and those
of some other Australian marsupials— should all be constructed on
the same extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second
and third digits extremely slender and enveloped within the same
skin, so that they appear like a single toe furnished with two
claws. Notwithstanding this similarity of pattern, it is obvious
that the hind feet of these several animals are used for as widely
different purposes as it is possible to conceive. The case is
rendered all the more striking by the American opossums, which
follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their Australian
relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan. Professor
Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in
conclusion: "We may call this conformity to type, without getting
much nearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;" and he then adds
"but is it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of
inheritance from a common ancestor?"</p>
<p>Geoffroy St. Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high
importance of relative position or connexion in homologous parts;
they may differ to almost any extent in form and size, and yet
remain connected together in the same invariable order. We never
find, for instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the
thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same names can be given to the
homologous bones in widely different animals. We see the same great
law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more
different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a
sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great
jaws of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely
different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications
of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The same law
governs the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So
it is with the flowers of plants.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this
similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or
by the doctrine of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt
has been expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on
the "Nature of Limbs." On the ordinary view of the independent
creation of each being, we can only say that so it is; that it has
pleased the Creator to construct all the animals and plants in each
great class on a uniform plan; but this is not a scientific
explanation.</p>
<p>The explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of
the selection of successive slight modifications, each being
profitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by
correlation other parts of the organisation. In changes of this
nature, there will be little or no tendency to alter the original
pattern, or to transpose the parts. The bones of a limb might be
shortened and flattened to any extent, becoming at the same time
enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed
hand might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any
extent, with the membrane connecting them increased, so as to serve
as a wing; yet all these modifications would not tend to alter the
framework of the bones or the relative connexion of the parts. If
we suppose that an early progenitor—the archetype, as it may be
called—of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs
constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose
they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the
homologous construction of the limbs throughout the class. So with
the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common
progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae,
these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural
selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and
function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable
that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured
as to be finally lost, by the reduction and ultimately by the
complete abortion of certain parts, by the fusion of other parts,
and by the doubling or multiplication of others, variations which
we know to be within the limits of possibility. In the paddles of
the gigantic extinct sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain
suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern seems thus to have
become partially obscured.</p>
<p>There is another and equally curious branch of our subject;
namely, serial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts
or organs in the same individual, and not of the same parts or
organs in different members of the same class. Most physiologists
believe that the bones of the skull are homologous—that is,
correspond in number and in relative connexion—with the elemental
parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior
limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes are plainly homologous.
So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws and legs of crustaceans.
It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative
position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as
their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they
consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous
plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one
organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see,
during the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as
well as in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which
when mature become extremely different are at first exactly
alike.</p>
<p>How inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the
ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a
box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped
pieces of bone apparently representing vertebrae? As Owen has
remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate
pieces in the act of parturition by mammals, will by no means
explain the same construction in the skulls of birds and reptiles.
Why should similar bones have been created to form the wing and the
leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes,
namely flying and walking? Why should one crustacean, which has an
extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always
have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler
mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, in
each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be all
constructed on the same pattern?</p>
<p>On the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent,
answer these questions. We need not here consider how the bodies of
some animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how
they became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding
organs, for such questions are almost beyond investigation. It is,
however, probable that some serial structures are the result of
cells multiplying by division, entailing the multiplication of the
parts developed from such cells. It must suffice for our purpose to
bear in mind that an indefinite repetition of the same part or
organ is the common characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all
low or little specialised forms; therefore the unknown progenitor
of the Vertebrata probably possessed many vertebrae; the unknown
progenitor of the Articulata, many segments; and the unknown
progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves arranged in one or more
spires. We have also formerly seen that parts many times repeated
are eminently liable to vary, not only in number, but in form.
Consequently such parts, being already present in considerable
numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford the
materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they
would generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain
traces of their original or fundamental resemblance. They would
retain this resemblance all the more, as the variations, which
afforded the basis for their subsequent modification through
natural selection, would tend from the first to be similar; the
parts being at an early stage of growth alike, and being subjected
to nearly the same conditions. Such parts, whether more or less
modified, unless their common origin became wholly obscured, would
be serially homologous.</p>
<p>In the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct
species can be shown to be homologous, only a few serial
homologies; such as the valves of Chitons, can be indicated; that
is, we are seldom enabled to say that one part is homologous with
another part in the same individual. And we can understand this
fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the class, we
do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part as
we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms.</p>
<p>But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first
appears, as has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr.
E. Ray Lankester, who has drawn an important distinction between
certain classes of cases which have all been equally ranked by
naturalists as homologous. He proposes to call the structures which
resemble each other in distinct animals, owing to their descent
from a common progenitor with subsequent modification,
"homogenous"; and the resemblances which cannot thus be accounted
for, he proposes to call "homoplastic". For instance, he believes
that the hearts of birds and mammals are as a whole homogenous—
that is, have been derived from a common progenitor; but that the
four cavities of the heart in the two classes are homoplastic—that
is, have been independently developed. Mr. Lankester also adduces
the close resemblance of the parts on the right and left sides of
the body, and in the successive segments of the same individual
animal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous which
bear no relation to the descent of distinct species from a common
progenitor. Homoplastic structures are the same with those which I
have classed, though in a very imperfect manner, as analogous
modifications or resemblances. Their formation may be attributed in
part to distinct organisms, or to distinct parts of the same
organism, having varied in an analogous manner; and in part to
similar modifications, having been preserved for the same general
purpose or function, of which many instances have been given.</p>
<p>Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of
metamorphosed vertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs;
the stamens and pistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it
would in most cases be more correct, as Professor Huxley has
remarked, to speak of both skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs,
etc., as having been metamorphosed, not one from the other, as they
now exist, but from some common and simpler element. Most
naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical
sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course of
descent, primordial organs of any kind—vertebrae in the one case
and legs in the other—have actually been converted into skulls or
jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of this having occurred that
naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain
signification. According to the views here maintained, such
language may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws,
for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which they
probably would have retained through inheritance, if they had
really been metamorphosed from true though extremely simple legs,
is in part explained.</p>
