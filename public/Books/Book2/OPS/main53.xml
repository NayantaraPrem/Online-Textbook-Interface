<h3 class="section_title">3. On The Origin And Transition Of
Organic Beings With Peculiar Habits And Structure</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how,
for instance, could a land carnivorous animal have been converted
into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its
transitional state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that
there now exist carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate
grades from strictly terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each
exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each must be well
adapted to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North
America, which has webbed feet, and which resembles an otter in its
fur, short legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives
for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the
frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats on mice and land
animals. If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked
how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted
into a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult
to answer. Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.</p>
<p>Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage,
for, out of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can
give only one or two instances of transitional habits and
structures in allied species; and of diversified habits, either
constant or occasional, in the same species. And it seems to me
that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to
lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the
bat.</p>
<p>Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest
gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened,
and from others, as Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the
posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on
their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and
flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail
united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and
allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance
from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to
each kind of squirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape
birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as
there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger from occasional
falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the structure of
each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all
possible conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change, let
other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old
ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that
some, at least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or
become exterminated, unless they also become modified and improved
in structure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no
difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in
the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller
flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being
propagated, until, by the accumulated effects of this process of
natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was
produced.</p>
<p>Now look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which
was formerly ranked among bats, but is now believed to belong to
the Insectivora. An extremely wide flank-membrane stretches from
the corners of the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the
elongated fingers. This flank- membrane is furnished with an
extensor muscle. Although no graduated links of structure, fitted
for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the
other Insectivora, yet there is no difficulty in supposing that
such links formerly existed, and that each was developed in the
same manner as with the less perfectly gliding squirrels; each
grade of structure having been useful to its possessor. Nor can I
see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible
that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the
Galeopithecus might have been greatly lengthened by natural
selection; and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned,
would have converted the animal into a bat. In certain bats in
which the wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the
tail and includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an
apparatus originally fitted for gliding through the air rather than
for flight.</p>
<p>If about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who
would have ventured to surmise that birds might have existed which
used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger headed duck
(Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and as front legs on
the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and
functionally for no purpose, like the apteryx? Yet the structure of
each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to
which it is exposed, for each has to live by a struggle: but it is
not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. It
must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of
wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the result
of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired
their perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what
diversified means of transition are at least possible.</p>
<p>Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the
Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing
that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most
diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is
conceivable that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air,
slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins,
might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. If this had
been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early
transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and
had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively, so far as we
know, to escape being devoured by other fish?</p>
<p>When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular
habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind
that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure
will seldom have survived to the present day, for they will have
been supplanted by their successors, which were gradually rendered
more perfect through natural selection. Furthermore, we may
conclude that transitional states between structures fitted for
very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an
early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms.
Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish,
it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would
have been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey
of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until
their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so
as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the
battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with
transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always
be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the
case of species with fully developed structures.</p>
<p>I will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and
of changed habits, in the individuals of the same species. In
either case it would be easy for natural selection to adapt the
structure of the animal to its changed habits, or exclusively to
one of its several habits. It is, however, difficult to decide and
immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and
structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure
lead to changed habits; both probably often occurring almost
simultaneously. Of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely
to allude to that of the many British insects which now feed on
exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. Of
diversified habits innumerable instances could be given: I have
often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in
South America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to
another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on
the margin of water, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at
a fish. In our own country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be
seen climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a
shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head; and I have many
times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch,
and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In North America the black
bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth,
thus catching, almost like a whale, insects in the water.</p>
<p>As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from
those proper to their species and to the other species of the same
genus, we might expect that such individuals would occasionally
give rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and with their
structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of
their type. And such instances occur in nature. Can a more striking
instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for
climbing trees and seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? Yet
in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit,
and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing. On
the plains of La Plata, where hardly a tree grows, there is a
woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which has two toes before and two
behind, a long- pointed tongue, pointed tail-feathers, sufficiently
stiff to support the bird in a vertical position on a post, but not
so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers, and a straight, strong
beak. The beak, however, is not so straight or so strong as in the
typical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore into wood.
Hence this Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its structure,
is a woodpecker. Even in such trifling characters as the colouring,
the harsh tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its close
blood-relationship to our common woodpecker is plainly declared;
yet, as I can assert, not only from my own observations, but from
those of the accurate Azara, in certain large districts it does not
climb trees, and it makes its nest in holes in banks! In certain
other districts, however, this same woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson
states, frequents trees, and bores holes in the trunk for its nest.
I may mention as another illustration of the varied habits of this
genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been described by De Saussure as
boring holes into hard wood in order to lay up a store of
acorns.</p>
<p>Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, but, in the
quiet sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its
general habits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner
of swimming and of flying when made to take flight, would be
mistaken by any one for an auk or a grebe; nevertheless, it is
essentially a petrel, but with many parts of its organisation
profoundly modified in relation to its new habits of life; whereas
the woodpecker of La Plata has had its structure only slightly
modified. In the case of the water-ouzel, the acutest observer, by
examining its dead body, would never have suspected its sub-aquatic
habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the thrush family,
subsists by diving,—using its wings under water and grasping stones
with its feet. All the members of the great order of Hymenopterous
insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes, which
Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it
often enters the water and dives about by the use not of its legs
but of its wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath the
surface; yet it exhibits no modification in structure in accordance
with its abnormal habits.</p>
<p>He who believes that each being has been created as we now see
it, must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an
animal having habits and structure not in agreement. What can be
plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for
swimming? Yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely
go near the water; and no one except Audubon, has seen the
frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight on the
surface of the ocean. On the other hand, grebes and coots are
eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by
membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes, not furnished
with membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking over
swamps and floating plants. The water-hen and landrail are members
of this order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and
the second is nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In
such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed
without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the
upland goose may be said to have become almost rudimentary in
function, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply
scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to
change.</p>
<p>He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may
say, that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a
being of one type to take the place of one belonging to another
type; but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified
language. He who believes in the struggle for existence and in the
principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic
being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that
if any one being varies ever so little, either in habits or
structure, and thus gains an advantage over some other inhabitant
of the same country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant,
however different that may be from its own place. Hence it will
cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds
with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on
the water, that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in
meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers
where hardly a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and
diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the habits of auks.</p>
