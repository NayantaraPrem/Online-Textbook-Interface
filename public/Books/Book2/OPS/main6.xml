<h3 class="section_title">Deflection of Light</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The bending of a ray of light thus described is much too light
on the surface of the earth to be observed. But the attraction of
gravitation exercised by the sun on its surface is, because of its
great mass, more than twenty-seven times stronger, and a ray of
light that goes close by the superficies of the sun must surely be
noticeably bent. The rays of a star that are seen at a short
distance from the edge of the sun will, going along the sun,
deviate so much from the original direction that they strike the
eye of an observer as if they came in a straight line from a point
somewhat further removed than the real position of the star from
the sun. It is at that point that we think we see the star; so here
is a seeming displacement from the sun, which increases in the
measure in which the star is observed closer to the sun. The
Einstein theory teaches that the displacement is in inverse
proportion to the apparent distance of the star from the centre of
the sun, and that for a star just on its edge it will amount to
1′.75 (1.75 seconds). This is approximately the thousandth part of
the apparent diameter of the sun.</p>
<p>Naturally, the phenomenon can only be observed when there is a
total eclipse of the sun; then one can take photographs of
neighboring stars and through comparing the plate with a picture of
the same part of the heavens taken at a time when the sun was far
removed from that point the sought-for movement to one side may
become apparent.</p>
<p>Thus to put the Einstein theory to the test was the principal
aim of the English expeditions sent out to observe the eclipse of
May 29, one to Prince's Island, off the coast of Guinea, and the
other to Sobral, Brazil. The first-named expedition's observers
were Eddington and Cottingham, those of the second, Crommelin and
Davidson. The conditions were especially favorable, for a very
large number of bright stars were shown on the photographic plate;
the observers at Sobral being particularly lucky in having good
weather.</p>
<p>The total eclipse lasted five minutes, during four of which it
was perfectly clear, so that good photographs could be taken. In
the report issued regarding the results the following figures,
which are the average of the measurements made from the seven
plates, are given for the displacements of seven stars:</p>
<p>1″.02, 0″.92, 0″.84, 0″.58, 0″.54, 0″.36, 0″.24, whereas,
according to the theory, the displacements should have amounted to:
0″.88, 0″.80, 0″.75, 0″.40, 0″.52, 0″.33, 0″.20.</p>
<p>If we consider that, according to the theory the displacements
must be in inverse ratio to the distance from the centre of the
sun, then we may deduce from each observed displacement how great
the sideways movement for a star at the edge of the sun should have
been. As the most probable result, therefore, the number 1″.98 was
found from all the observations together. As the last of the
displacements given above—<em>i.e.,</em>&#160;0″.24 is about
one-eighth of this, we may say that the influence of the attraction
of the sun upon light made itself felt upon the ray at a distance
eight times removed from its centre.</p>
<p>The displacements calculated according to the theory are, just
because of the way in which they are calculated, in inverse
proportion to the distance to the centre. Now that the observed
deviations also accord with the same rule, it follows that they are
surely proportionate with the calculated displacements. The
proportion of the first and the last observed sidewise movements is
4.2, and that of the two most extreme of the calculated numbers is
4.4.</p>
<p>This result is of importance, because thereby the theory is
excluded, or at least made extremely improbable, that the
phenomenon of refraction is to be ascribed to, a ring of vapor
surrounding the sun for a great distance. Indeed, such a refraction
should cause a deviation in the observed direction, and, in order
to produce the displacement of one of the stars under observation
itself a slight proximity of the vapor ring should be sufficient,
but we have every reason to expect that if it were merely a
question of a mass of gas around the sun the diminishing effect
accompanying a removal from the sun should manifest itself much
faster than is really the case. We cannot speak with perfect
certainty here, as all the factors that might be of influence upon
the distribution of density in a sun atmosphere are not well enough
known, but we can surely demonstrate that in case one of the gasses
with which we are acquainted were held in equilibrium solely by the
influence of attraction of the sun the phenomenon should become
much less as soon as we got somewhat further from the edge of the
sun. If the displacement of the first star, which amounts to
1.02-seconds were to be ascribed to such a mass of gas, then the
displacement of the second must already be entirely
inappreciable.</p>
<p>So far as the absolute extent of the displacements is concerned,
it was found somewhat too great, as has been shown by the figures
given above; it also appears from the final result to be 1.98 for
the edge of the sun—<em>i.e.,</em>&#160;13 per cent, greater than
the theoretical value of 1.75. It indeed seems that the
discrepancies may be ascribed to faults in observations, which
supposition is supported by the fact that the observations at
Prince's Island, which, it is true, did not turn out quite as well
as those mentioned above, gave the result, of 1.64, somewhat lower
than Einstein's figure.</p>
<p>(The observations made with a second instrument at Sobral gave a
result of 0.93, but the observers are of the opinion that because
of the shifting of the mirror which reflected the rays no value is
to be attached to it.)</p>
