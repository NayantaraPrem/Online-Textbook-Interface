<h3 class="section_title">2. Inherited Changes Of Habit Or Instinct
In Domesticated Animals</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of
instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly
considering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus be
enabled to see the part which habit and the selection of so-called
spontaneous variations have played in modifying the mental
qualities of our domestic animals. It is notorious how much
domestic animals vary in their mental qualities. With cats, for
instance, one naturally takes to catching rats, and another mice,
and these tendencies are known to be inherited. One cat, according
to Mr. St. John, always brought home game birds, another hares or
rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground and almost nightly
caught woodcocks or snipes. A number of curious and authentic
instances could be given of various shades of disposition and
taste, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain
frames of mind or periods of time. But let us look to the familiar
case of the breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young
pointers (I have myself seen striking instances) will sometimes
point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are
taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by
retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a flock of
sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions, performed
without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by
each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and
without the end being known—for the young pointer can no more know
that he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows
why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage—I cannot see that
these actions differ essentially from true instincts. If we were to
behold one kind of wolf, when young and without any training, as
soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a statue, and
then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another kind of
wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving them
to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions
instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are
certainly far less fixed than natural instincts; but they have been
acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted
for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of
life.</p>
<p>How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions
are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown
when different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a
cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage
and obstinacy of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given
to a whole family of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These
domestic instincts, when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural
instincts, which in a like manner become curiously blended
together, and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of
either parent: for example, Le Roy describes a dog, whose
great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its
wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to
his master, when called.</p>
<p>Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have
become inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit,
but this is not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching,
or probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble—an
action which, as I have witnessed, is performed by young birds,
that have never seen a pigeon tumble. We may believe that some one
pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the
long-continued selection of the best individuals in successive
generations made tumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow there
are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent, which cannot fly
eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It may be
doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to
point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this
line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a
pure terrier: the act of pointing is probably, as many have
thought, only the exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to
spring on its prey. When the first tendency to point was once
displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of
compulsory training in each successive generation would soon
complete the work; and unconscious selection is still in progress,
as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the
breed, dogs which stand and hunt best. On the other hand, habit
alone in some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal is more
difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any
animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly
suppose that domestic rabbits have often been selected for tameness
alone; so that we must attribute at least the greater part of the
inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness, to
habit and long-continued close confinement.</p>
<p>Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable
instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely
or never become "broody," that is, never wish to sit on their eggs.
Familiarity alone prevents our seeing how largely and how
permanently the minds of our domestic animals have been modified.
It is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become
instinctive in the dog. All wolves, foxes, jackals and species of
the cat genus, when kept tame, are most eager to attack poultry,
sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs
which have been brought home as puppies from countries such as
Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do not keep these
domestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised
dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to attack
poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an
attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed;
so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred
in civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand, young
chickens have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat
which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, for I am
informed by Captain Hutton that the young chickens of the parent
stock, the Gallus bankiva, when reared in India under a hen, are at
first excessively wild. So it is with young pheasants reared in
England under a hen. It is not that chickens have lost all fear,
but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger
chuckle they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under
her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets;
and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing,
as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. But this
instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under
domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the
power of flight.</p>
<p>Hence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have
been acquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit
and partly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive
generations, peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first
appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. In
some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce inherited
mental changes; in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing,
and all has been the result of selection, pursued both methodically
and unconsciously; but in most cases habit and selection have
probably concurred.</p>
