<h3 class="section_title">7. Circumstances Favourable To Man's
Power Of Selection</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or
the reverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of
variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials
for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are
not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the
accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any
desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing
to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance
will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept.
Hence number is of the highest importance for success. On this
principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect to the sheep of
part of Yorkshire, "As they generally belong to poor people, and
are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be improved." On the other
hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant, are
generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and
valuable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or
plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation
are favourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed
to breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually
prevent selection. But probably the most important element is that
the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man, that the
closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its
qualities or structure. Unless such attention be paid nothing can
be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most
fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners
began to attend to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had always
varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been
neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual
plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised
seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and
bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species)
those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which
have appeared during the last half-century.</p>
<p>With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important
element in the formation of new racesâ€”at least, in a country which
is already stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of
the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open
plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species.
Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to
the fancier, for thus many races may be improved and kept true,
though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have
largely favoured the formation of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add,
can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and
inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve
for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling
habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued by
women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up;
such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from
some other country. Although I do not doubt that some domestic
animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of
distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may
be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought
into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in
donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little
attention paid to their breeding; for recently in certain parts of
Spain and of the United States this animal has been surprisingly
modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks, from not
being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from
being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more
especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of
distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is
exposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible
organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have
elsewhere described.</p>
<p>Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our
domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be
exceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has
been attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and
plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent
period; and this implies variation. It would be equally rash to
assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit, could
not, after remaining fixed for many centuries, again vary under new
conditions of life. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much
truth, a limit will be at last reached. For instance, there must be
a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal, as this will be
determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of the body
to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres.
But what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same
species differ from each other in almost every character, which man
has attended to and selected, more than do the distinct species of
the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire has proved this in
regard to size, and so it is with colour, and probably with the
length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which depends on many
bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and a dray-horse is
comparably stronger, than any two natural species belonging to the
same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different varieties of
the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the seeds of
the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families. The
same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several
varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as
well as in many other analogous cases.</p>
<p>To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and
plants. Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in
causing variability, both by acting directly on the organisation,
and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not
probable that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent,
under all circumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance
and reversion determine whether variations shall endure.
Variability is governed by many unknown laws, of which correlated
growth is probably the most important. Something, but how much we
do not know, may be attributed to the definite action of the
conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great, effect may be attributed
to the increased use or disuse of parts. The final result is thus
rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the intercrossing of
aboriginally distinct species appears to have played an important
part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have once
been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with
the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation
of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much
exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which
are propagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily
propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of crossing is
immense; for the cultivator may here disregard the extreme
variability both of hybrids and of mongrels, and the sterility of
hybrids; but plants not propagated by seed are of little importance
to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these causes
of change, the accumulative action of selection, whether applied
methodically and quickly, or unconsciously and slowly, but more
efficiently, seems to have been the predominant power.</p>
