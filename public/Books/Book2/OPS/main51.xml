<p>Long before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a
crowd of difficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are
so serious that to this day I can hardly reflect on them without
being in some degree staggered; but, to the best of my judgment,
the greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are
not, I think, fatal to the theory.</p>
<p>These difficulties and objections may be classed under the
following heads: First, why, if species have descended from other
species by fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable
transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of
the species being, as we see them, well defined?</p>
<p>Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance,
the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the
modification of some other animal with widely different habits and
structure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on
the one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of
a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand,
an organ so wonderful as the eye?</p>
<p>Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural
selection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to
make cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries
of profound mathematicians?</p>
<p>Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being
sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties
are crossed, their fertility is unimpaired?</p>
<p>The two first heads will be here discussed; some miscellaneous
objections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the
two succeeding chapters.</p>
