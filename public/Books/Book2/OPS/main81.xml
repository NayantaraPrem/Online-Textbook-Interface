<h3 class="section_title">2. On The Lapse Of Time, As Inferred From
The Rate Of Deposition And Extent Of Denudation</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such
infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected that time
cannot have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all
changes having been effected slowly. It is hardly possible for me
to recall to the reader who is not a practical geologist, the facts
leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can
read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology,
which the future historian will recognise as having produced a
revolution in natural science, and yet does not admit how vast have
been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. Not
that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology, or to read
special treatises by different observers on separate formations,
and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of
the duration of each formation, or even of each stratum. We can
best gain some idea of past time by knowing the agencies at work;
and learning how deeply the surface of the land has been denuded,
and how much sediment has been deposited. As Lyell has well
remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations
are the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth's
crust has elsewhere undergone. Therefore a man should examine for
himself the great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the
rivulets bringing down mud, and the waves wearing away the
sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend something about the duration of
past time, the monuments of which we see all around us.</p>
<p>It is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately
hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most
cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the
waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or
pebbles; for there is good evidence that pure water effects nothing
in wearing away rock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined,
huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be
worn away atom by atom, until after being reduced in size they can
be rolled about by the waves, and then they are more quickly ground
into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often do we see along the bases
of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by
marine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how
seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for a few
miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we
find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round
a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering.
The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that
elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their
base.</p>
<p>We have, however, recently learned from the observations of
Ramsay, in the van of many excellent observers—of Jukes, Geikie,
Croll and others, that subaerial degradation is a much more
important agency than coast-action, or the power of the waves. The
whole surface of the land is exposed to the chemical action of the
air and of the rainwater, with its dissolved carbonic acid, and in
colder countries to frost; the disintegrated matter is carried down
even gentle slopes during heavy rain, and to a greater extent than
might be supposed, especially in arid districts, by the wind; it is
then transported by the streams and rivers, which, when rapid
deepen their channels, and triturate the fragments. On a rainy day,
even in a gently undulating country, we see the effects of
subaerial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down every
slope. Messrs. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the observation
is a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment in the
Wealden district and those ranging across England, which formerly
were looked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus formed,
for each line is composed of one and the same formation, while our
sea-cliffs are everywhere formed by the intersection of various
formations. This being the case, we are compelled to admit that the
escarpments owe their origin in chief part to the rocks of which
they are composed, having resisted subaerial denudation better than
the surrounding surface; this surface consequently has been
gradually lowered, with the lines of harder rock left projecting.
Nothing impresses the mind with the vast duration of time,
according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the conviction
thus gained that subaerial agencies, which apparently have so
little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great
results.</p>
<p>When thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn
away through subaerial and littoral action, it is good, in order to
appreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand,
the masses of rock which have been removed over many extensive
areas, and on the other hand the thickness of our sedimentary
formations. I remember having been much struck when viewing
volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all
round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in
height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their
formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky
beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is told
still more plainly by faults—those great cracks along which the
strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other,
to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust
cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was
sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected
by many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely
planed down that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally
visible. The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of
thirty miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the
strata varies from 600 to 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay has
published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and
he informs me that he fully believes that there is one in
Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing
on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements; the
pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly
swept away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in all parts of the world the piles of
sedimentary strata are of wonderful thickness. In the Cordillera, I
estimated one mass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and
although conglomerates have probably been accumulated at a quicker
rate than finer sediments, yet from being formed of worn and
rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of time, they are
good to show how slowly the mass must have been heaped together.
Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, from actual
measurement in most cases, of the successive formations in
DIFFERENT parts of Great Britain; and this is the result: Feet
Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds)..57,154 Secondary
strata… … … … … … … … … … ..13,190 Tertiary strata… … … … … … … … …
… … .2,240</p>
<p>—making altogether 72,584 feet; that is, very nearly thirteen
and three-quarters British miles. Some of these formations, which
are represented in England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in
thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between each successive
formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists, blank periods
of enormous length. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in
Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed
during their accumulation. The consideration of these various facts
impresses the mind almost in the same manner as does the vain
endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this impression is partly false. Mr. Croll, in an
interesting paper, remarks that we do not err "in forming too great
a conception of the length of geological periods," but in
estimating them by years. When geologists look at large and
complicated phenomena, and then at the figures representing several
million years, the two produce a totally different effect on the
mind, and the figures are at once pronounced too small. In regard
to subaerial denudation, Mr. Croll shows, by calculating the known
amount of sediment annually brought down by certain rivers,
relatively to their areas of drainage, that 1,000 feet of solid
rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would thus be removed
from the mean level of the whole area in the course of six million
years. This seems an astonishing result, and some considerations
lead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if halved or
quartered it is still very surprising. Few of us, however, know
what a million really means: Mr. Croll gives the following
illustration: Take a narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four
inches in length, and stretch it along the wall of a large hall;
then mark off at one end the tenth of an inch. This tenth of an
inch will represent one hundred years, and the entire strip a
million years. But let it be borne in mind, in relation to the
subject of this work, what a hundred years implies, represented as
it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a hall of the above
dimensions. Several eminent breeders, during a single lifetime,
have so largely modified some of the higher animals, which
propagate their kind much more slowly than most of the lower
animals, that they have formed what well deserves to be called a
new sub-breed. Few men have attended with due care to any one
strain for more than half a century, so that a hundred years
represents the work of two breeders in succession. It is not to be
supposed that species in a state of nature ever change so quickly
as domestic animals under the guidance of methodical selection. The
comparison would be in every way fairer with the effects which
follow from unconscious selection, that is, the preservation of the
most useful or beautiful animals, with no intention of modifying
the breed; but by this process of unconscious selection, various
breeds have been sensibly changed in the course of two or three
centuries.</p>
<p>Species, however, probably change much more slowly, and within
the same country only a few change at the same time. This slowness
follows from all the inhabitants of the same country being already
so well adapted to each other, that new places in the polity of
nature do not occur until after long intervals, due to the
occurrence of physical changes of some kind, or through the
immigration of new forms. Moreover, variations or individual
differences of the right nature, by which some of the inhabitants
might be better fitted to their new places under the altered
circumstance, would not always occur at once. Unfortunately we have
no means of determining, according to the standard of years, how
long a period it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of
time we must return.</p>
