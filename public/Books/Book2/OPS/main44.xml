<h3 class="section_title">6. Multiple, Rudimentary, And
Lowly-Organised Structures Are Variable</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire,
both with varieties and species, that when any part or organ is
repeated many times in the same individual (as the vertebrae in
snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is
variable; whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it
occurs in lesser numbers, is constant. The same author as well as
some botanists, have further remarked that multiple parts are
extremely liable to vary in structure. As "vegetative repetition,"
to use Professor Owen's expression, is a sign of low organisation;
the foregoing statements accord with the common opinion of
naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale of nature are
more variable than those which are higher. I presume that lowness
here means that the several parts of the organisation have been but
little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the
same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why
it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should
not have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form so
carefully as when the part has to serve for some one special
purpose. In the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of
things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for some
particular purpose must be of some particular shape. Natural
selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely through and
for the advantage of each being.</p>
<p>Rudimentary parts, as is generally admitted, are apt to be
highly variable. We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will
here only add that their variability seems to result from their
uselessness, and consequently from natural selection having had no
power to check deviations in their structure.</p>
