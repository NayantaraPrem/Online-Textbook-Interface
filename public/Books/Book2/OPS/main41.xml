<h3 class="section_title">3. Acclimatisation</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering,
in the time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to
germinate, etc., and this leads me to say a few words on
acclimatisation. As it is extremely common for distinct species
belonging to the same genus to inhabit hot and cold countries, if
it be true that all the species of the same genus are descended
from a single parent-form, acclimatisation must be readily effected
during a long course of descent. It is notorious that each species
is adapted to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic
or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate,
or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp
climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates
under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this from
our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant
will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals
brought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy.
We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are
closely limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic
beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular
climates. But whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very
close, we have evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to
a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures;
that is, they become acclimatised: thus the pines and
rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from the
same species growing at different heights on the Himalayas, were
found to possess in this country different constitutional powers of
resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed
similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations have been made by
Mr. H.C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the
Azores to England; and I could give other cases. In regard to
animals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species
having largely extended, within historical times, their range from
warmer to colder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not
positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their
native climate, though in all ordinary cases we assume such to be
the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become
specially acclimatised to their new homes, so as to be better
fitted for them than they were at first.</p>
<p>As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen
by uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred
readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently
found capable of far-extended transportation, the common and
extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only
withstanding the most different climates, but of being perfectly
fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used as an argument
that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature
could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. We must
not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on account of
the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several
wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf
may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat and mouse
cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been
transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far
wider range than any other rodent; for they live under the cold
climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south,
and on many an island in the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any
special climate may be looked at as a quality readily grafted on an
innate wide flexibility of constitution, common to most animals. On
this view, the capacity of enduring the most different climates by
man himself and by his domestic animals, and the fact of the
extinct elephant and rhinoceros having formerly endured a glacial
climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or
sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as
anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of
constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into
action.</p>
<p>How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar
climate is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection
of varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to
both means combined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom
has some influence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the
incessant advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient
Encyclopaedias of China, to be very cautious in transporting
animals from one district to another. And as it is not likely that
man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and
sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own
districts, the result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other
hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to preserve those
individuals which were born with constitutions best adapted to any
country which they inhabited. In treatises on many kinds of
cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain
climates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on
fruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain
varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others
for the southern states; and as most of these varieties are of
recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to
habit. The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never
propagated in England by seed, and of which, consequently, new
varieties have not been produced, has even been advanced, as
proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it is now as
tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has been
often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight;
but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his
kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by
frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to
prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these
seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said
to have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in
the constitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an
account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings are
than others; and of this fact I have myself observed striking
instances.</p>
<p>On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse,
have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification
of the constitution and structure; but that the effects have often
been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the
natural selection of innate variations.</p>
