Chapters</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely
imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been
geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of
organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that
the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our
museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the number of
generations which must have passed away even during a single
formation; that, owing to subsidence being almost necessary for the
accumulation of deposits rich in fossil species of many kinds, and
thick enough to outlast future degradation, great intervals of time
must have elapsed between most of our successive formations; that
there has probably been more extinction during the periods of
subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and
during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept;
that each single formation has not been continuously deposited;
that the duration of each formation is probably short compared with
the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played
an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one
area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which
have varied most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new
species; that varieties have at first been local; and lastly,
although each species must have passed through numerous
transitional stages, it is probable that the periods, during which
each underwent modification, though many and long as measured by
years, have been short in comparison with the periods during which
each remained in an unchanged condition. These causes, taken
conjointly, will to a large extent explain why—though we do find
many links—we do not find interminable varieties, connecting
together all extinct and existing forms by the finest graduated
steps. It should also be constantly borne in mind that any linking
variety between two forms, which might be found, would be ranked,
unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new and
distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure
criterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.</p>
<p>He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological
record, will rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in
vain where are the numberless transitional links which must
formerly have connected the closely allied or representative
species, found in the successive stages of the same great
formation? He may disbelieve in the immense intervals of time which
must have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may
overlook how important a part migration has played, when the
formations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are
considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent,
sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are
the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have
existed long before the Cambrian system was deposited? We now know
that at least one animal did then exist; but I can answer this last
question only by supposing that where our oceans now extend they
have extended for an enormous period, and where our oscillating
continents now stand they have stood since the commencement of the
Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch, the world
presented a widely different aspect; and that the older continents,
formed of formations older than any known to us, exist now only as
remnants in a metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under
the ocean.</p>
<p>Passing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts
in palaeontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with
modification through variation and natural selection. We can thus
understand how it is that new species come in slowly and
successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily
change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in
the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. The
extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the
production of new forms. We can understand why, when a species has
once disappeared, it never reappears. Groups of species increase in
numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the
process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many
complex contingencies. The dominant species belonging to large and
dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, which form
new sub-groups and groups. As these are formed, the species of the
less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a
common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no
modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter
extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow
process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in
protected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly
disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has
been broken.</p>
<p>We can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread
widely and yield the greatest number of varieties tend to people
the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will
generally succeed in displacing the groups which are their
inferiors in the struggle for existence. Hence, after long
intervals of time, the productions of the world appear to have
changed simultaneously.</p>
<p>We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient
and recent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand,
from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the
more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those
now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up
gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups,
previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly bringing
them only a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the
more often it stands in some degree intermediate between groups now
distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will
be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of
groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom
directly intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate
only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct and
different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of
closely consecutive formations are closely allied; for they are
closely linked together by generation. We can clearly see why the
remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in
character.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its
history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and
are, in so far, higher in the scale, and their structure has
generally become more specialised; and this may account for the
common belief held by so many palaeontologists, that organisation
on the whole has progressed. Extinct and ancient animals resemble
to a certain extent the embryos of the more recent animals
belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fact receives a
simple explanation according to our views. The succession of the
same types of structure within the same areas during the later
geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on
the principle of inheritance.</p>
<p>If, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe,
and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to
be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural
selection are greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand,
all the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems
to me, that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old
forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, the
products of variation and the survival of the fittest.</p>
