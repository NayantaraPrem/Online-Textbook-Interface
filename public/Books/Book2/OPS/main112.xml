<h3 class="section_title">6. Rudimentary, Atrophied, And Aborted
Organs</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain
stamp of inutility, are extremely common, or even general,
throughout nature. It would be impossible to name one of the higher
animals in which some part or other is not in a rudimentary
condition. In the mammalia, for instance, the males possess
rudimentary mammae; in snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary;
in birds the "bastard-wing" may safely be considered as a
rudimentary digit, and in some species the whole wing is so far
rudimentary that it cannot be used for flight. What can be more
curious than the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when
grown up have not a tooth in their heads; or the teeth, which never
cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of unborn calves?</p>
<p>Rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in
various ways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied
species, or even to the same identical species, which have either
full-sized and perfect wings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which
not rarely lie under wing-covers firmly soldered together; and in
these cases it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent
wings. Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality: this
occasionally occurs with the mammae of male mammals, which have
been known to become well developed and to secrete milk. So again
in the udders of the genus Bos, there are normally four developed
and two rudimentary teats; but the latter in our domestic cows
sometimes become well developed and yield milk. In regard to
plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and sometimes well
developed in the individuals of the same species. In certain plants
having separated sexes Kolreuter found that by crossing a species,
in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil, with an
hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed pistil,
the rudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size;
and this clearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are
essentially alike in nature. An animal may possess various parts in
a perfect state, and yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for
they are useless: thus the tadpole of the common salamander or
water-newt, as Mr. G.H. Lewes remarks, "has gills, and passes its
existence in the water; but the Salamandra atra, which lives high
up among the mountains, brings forth its young full-formed. This
animal never lives in the water. Yet if we open a gravid female, we
find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely feathered gills; and when
placed in water they swim about like the tadpoles of the
water-newt. Obviously this aquatic organisation has no reference to
the future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation to its
embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral
adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its
progenitors."</p>
<p>An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or
utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and
remain perfectly efficient for the other. Thus, in plants, the
office of the pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the
ovules within the ovarium. The pistil consists of a stigma
supported on the style; but in some Compositae, the male florets,
which of course cannot be fecundated, have a rudimentary pistil,
for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style remains well
developed and is clothed in the usual manner with hairs, which
serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and conjoined
anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper
purpose, and be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the
swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of
giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing
organ or lung. Many similar instances could be given.</p>
<p>Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we
have reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly
developed, ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be
in a nascent condition, and in progress towards further
development. Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are either
quite useless, such as teeth which never cut through the gums, or
almost useless, such as the wings of an ostrich, which serve merely
as sails. As organs in this condition would formerly, when still
less developed, have been of even less use than at present, they
cannot formerly have been produced through variation and natural
selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful
modifications. They have been partially retained by the power of
inheritance, and relate to a former state of things. It is,
however, often difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and
nascent organs; for we can judge only by analogy whether a part is
capable of further development, in which case alone it deserves to
be called nascent. Organs in this condition will always be somewhat
rare; for beings thus provided will commonly have been supplanted
by their successors with the same organ in a more perfect state,
and consequently will have become long ago extinct. The wing of the
penguin is of high service, acting as a fin; it may, therefore,
represent the nascent state of the wing: not that I believe this to
be the case; it is more probably a reduced organ, modified for a
new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on the other hand, is quite
useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen considers the simple
filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the "beginnings of organs
which attain full functional development in higher vertebrates;"
but, according to the view lately advocated by Dr. Gunther, they
are probably remnants, consisting of the persistent axis of a fin,
with the lateral rays or branches aborted. The mammary glands of
the Ornithorhynchus may be considered, in comparison with the
udders of a cow, as in a nascent condition. The ovigerous frena of
certain cirripedes, which have ceased to give attachment to the ova
and are feebly developed, are nascent branchiae.</p>
<p>Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are
very liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other
respects. In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the
same organ has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter
fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths
belonging to the same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly
aborted; and this implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts
are entirely absent which analogy would lead us to expect to find
in them, and which are occasionally found in monstrous individuals.
Thus in most of the Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly
aborted; yet we may conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for
a rudiment of it is found in many species of the family, and this
rudiment occasionally becomes perfectly developed, as may sometimes
be seen in the common snap-dragon. In tracing the homologies of any
part in different members of the same class, nothing is more
common, or, in order fully to understand the relations of the
parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments. This is well
shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the horse,
ox, and rhinoceros.</p>
<p>It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth
in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in
the embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe,
a universal rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the
embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so
that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even
cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary
organs in the adult are often said to have retained their embryonic
condition.</p>
<p>I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary
organs. In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with
astonishment; for the same reasoning power which tells us that most
parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes,
tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied
organs are imperfect and useless. In works on natural history,
rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created "for the
sake of symmetry," or in order "to complete the scheme of nature."
But this is not an explanation, merely a restatement of the fact.
Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the boa-constrictor has
rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it be said that
these bones have been retained "to complete the scheme of nature,"
why, as Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained by
other snakes, which do not possess even a vestige of these same
bones? What would be thought of an astronomer who maintained that
the satellites revolve in elliptic courses round their planets "for
the sake of symmetry," because the planets thus revolve round the
sun? An eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of
rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete matter
in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but can we suppose
that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male
flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue, can thus act?
Can we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently
absorbed, are beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by
removing matter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a man's
fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails have been known to
appear on the stumps, and I could as soon believe that these
vestiges of nails are developed in order to excrete horny matter,
as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee have been
developed for this same purpose.</p>
<p>On the view of descent with modification, the origin of
rudimentary organs is comparatively simple; and we can understand
to a large extent the laws governing their imperfect development.
We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic
productions, as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds, the vestige
of an ear in earless breeds of sheep—the reappearance of minute
dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially,
according to Youatt, in young animals—and the state of the whole
flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of various parts
in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on
the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than
by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of
evidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo
great and abrupt changes. But we learn from the study of our
domestic productions that the disuse of parts leads to their
reduced size; and that the result is inherited.</p>
<p>It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in
rendering organs rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps
to the more and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it
became rudimentary—as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting
dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands,
which have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and
have ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful
under certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as
with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and
in this case natural selection will have aided in reducing the
organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.</p>
<p>Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by
small stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an
organ rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or
injurious for one purpose, might be modified and used for another
purpose. An organ might, also, be retained for one alone of its
former functions. Organs, originally formed by the aid of natural
selection, when rendered useless may well be variable, for their
variations can no longer be checked by natural selection. All this
agrees well with what we see under nature. Moreover, at whatever
period of life either disuse or selection reduces an organ, and
this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to
exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at
corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced
state at the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the
embryo. Thus we can understand the greater size of rudimentary
organs in the embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, and their
lesser relative size in the adult. If, for instance, the digit of
an adult animal was used less and less during many generations,
owing to some change of habits, or if an organ or gland was less
and less functionally exercised, we may infer that it would become
reduced in size in the adult descendants of this animal, but would
retain nearly its original standard of development in the
embryo.</p>
<p>There remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has
ceased being used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how
can it be still further reduced in size until the merest vestige is
left; and how can it be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely
possible that disuse can go on producing any further effect after
the organ has once been rendered functionless. Some additional
explanation is here requisite which I cannot give. If, for
instance, it could be proved that every part of the organisation
tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than toward
augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an
organ which has become useless would be rendered, independently of
the effects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly
suppressed; for the variations towards diminished size would no
longer be checked by natural selection. The principle of the
economy of growth, explained in a former chapter, by which the
materials forming any part, if not useful to the possessor, are
saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come into play in
rendering a useless part rudimentary. But this principle will
almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process
of reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for
instance, representing in a male flower the pistil of the female
flower, and formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further
reduced or absorbed for the sake of economising nutriment.</p>
<p>Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have
been degraded into their present useless condition, are the record
of a former state of things, and have been retained solely through
the power of inheritance—we can understand, on the genealogical
view of classification, how it is that systematists, in placing
organisms in their proper places in the natural system, have often
found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful
than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs
may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the
spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve
as a clue for its derivation. On the view of descent with
modification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a
rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted,
far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on
the old doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated in
accordance with the views here explained.</p>
