<p><em>A Concise Statement by Prof. H. A. Lorentz, of the
University of Leyden</em></p>
<p>The total eclipse of the sun of May 29, resulted in a striking
confirmation of the new theory of the universal attractive power of
gravitation developed by Albert Einstein, and thus reinforced the
conviction that the defining of this theory is one of the most
important steps ever taken in the domain of natural science. In
response to a request by the editor, I will attempt to contribute
something to its 6general appreciation in the following lines.</p>
<p>For centuries Newton's doctrine of the attraction of gravitation
has been the most prominent example of a theory of natural science.
Through the simplicity of its basic idea, an attraction between two
bodies proportionate to their mass and also proportionate to the
square of the distance; through the completeness with which it
explained so many of the peculiarities in the movement of the
bodies making up the solar system; and, finally, through its
universal validity, even in the case of the far-distant planetary
systems, it compelled the admiration of all.</p>
<p>But, while the skill of the mathematicians was devoted to making
more exact calculations of the consequences to which it led, no
real progress was made in the science of gravitation. It is true
that the inquiry was transferred to the field of physics, following
Cavendish's success in demonstrating the common attraction between
bodies with which laboratory work can be done, but it always was
evident that natural philosophy had no grip on the universal power
of attraction. While in electric effects an influence exercised by
the matter placed between bodies was speedily observed—the
starting-point of a new and fertile doctrine of electricity—in the
case of gravitation not a trace of an influence exercised by
intermediate matter could ever be discovered. It was, and remained,
inaccessible and unchangeable, without any connection, apparently,
with other phenomena of natural philosophy.</p>
<p>Einstein has put an end to this isolation; it is now well
established that gravitation affects not only matter, but also
light. Thus strengthened in the faith that his theory already has
inspired, we may assume with him that there is not a single
physical or chemical phenomenon—which does not feel, although very
probably in an unnoticeable degree, the influence of gravitation,
and that, on the other side, the attraction exercised by a body is
limited in the first place by the quantity of matter it contains
and also, to some degree, by motion and by the physical and
chemical condition in which it moves.</p>
<p>It is comprehensible that a person could not have arrived at
such a far-reaching change of view by continuing to follow the old
beaten paths, but only by introducing some sort of new idea.
Indeed, Einstein arrived at his theory through a train of thought
of great originality. Let me try to restate it in concise
terms.</p>
