<h3 class="section_title">8. Specific Characters More Variable Than
Generic Characters</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to
our present subject. It is notorious that specific characters are
more variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is
meant: if in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers
and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character,
and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying
into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers,
the colour would become a generic character, and its variation
would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example
because the explanation which most naturalists would advance is not
here applicable, namely, that specific characters are more variable
than generic, because they are taken from parts of less
physiological importance than those commonly used for classing
genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly,
true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in the chapter
on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce
evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific
characters are more variable than generic; but with respect to
important characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural
history, that when an author remarks with surprise that some
important organ or part, which is generally very constant
throughout a large group of species, DIFFERS considerably in
closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE in the individuals of
the same species. And this fact shows that a character, which is
generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only
of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological
importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind applies
to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire apparently
entertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the
different species of the same group, the more subject it is to
anomalies in the individuals.</p>
<p>On the ordinary view of each species having been independently
created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from
the same part in other independently created species of the same
genus, be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in
the several species? I do not see that any explanation can be
given. But on the view that species are only strongly marked and
fixed varieties, we might expect often to find them still
continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have
varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come
to differ. Or to state the case in another manner: the points in
which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which
they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters; and
these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common
progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection
will have modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less
widely different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these
so-called generic characters have been inherited from before the
period when the several species first branched off from their
common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to
differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not
probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other
hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the
same genus are called specific characters; and as these specific
characters have varied and come to differ since the period when the
species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable that
they should still often be in some degree variableâ€”at least more
variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very
long period remained constant.</p>
