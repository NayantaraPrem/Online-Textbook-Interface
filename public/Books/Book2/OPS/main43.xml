<h3 class="section_title">5. Compensation And Economy Of
Growth</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same
time, their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as
Goethe expressed it, "in order to spend on one side, nature is
forced to economise on the other side." I think this holds true to
a certain extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment
flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in
excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give
much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties of the cabbage
do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply
of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits become
atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality. In
our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally
accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished
wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be
maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good
observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will
not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of
distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part
being largely developed through natural selection and another and
adjoining part being reduced by the same process or by disuse, and,
on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part
owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part.</p>
<p>I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which
have been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged
under a more general principle, namely, that natural selection is
continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation.
If under changed conditions of life a structure, before useful,
becomes less useful, its diminution will be favoured, for it will
profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building
up a useless structure. I can thus only understand a fact with
which I was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which
many other instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede
is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus protected, it
loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. This is
the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner
with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes
consists of the three highly important anterior segments of the
head enormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and
muscles; but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole
anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment
attached to the bases of the prehensile antennae. Now the saving of
a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous, would be
a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species;
for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed, each
would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment
being wasted.</p>
<p>Thus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run
to reduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes,
through changed habits, superfluous, without by any means causing
some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree.
And conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed
in largely developing an organ without requiring as a necessary
compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.</p>
