<h3 class="section_title">7. Hybrids And Mongrels Compared,
Independently Of Their Fertility</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of
species and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several
other respects. Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a
distinct line between species and varieties, could find very few,
and, as it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the
so-called hybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel
offspring of varieties. And, on the other hand, they agree most
closely in many important respects.</p>
<p>I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most
important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are
more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from
species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the
first generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this
fact. Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely
allied species are more variable than those from very distinct
species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of
variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more fertile
hybrids are propagated for several generations, an extreme amount
of variability in the offspring in both cases is notorious; but
some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels long retaining a
uniform character could be given. The variability, however, in the
successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in
hybrids.</p>
<p>This greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not
seem at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties,
and mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been
tried on natural varieties), and this implies that there has been
recent variability; which would often continue and would augment
that arising from the act of crossing. The slight variability of
hybrids in the first generation, in contrast with that in the
succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention.
For it bears on the view which I have taken of one of the causes of
ordinary variability; namely, that the reproductive system, from
being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life, fails
under these circumstances to perform its proper function of
producing offspring closely similar in all respects to the
parent-form. Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended
from species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had
their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not
variable; but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems
seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.</p>
<p>But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner
states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to
either parent form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a
difference in degree. Moreover, Gartner expressly states that the
hybrids from long cultivated plants are more subject to reversion
than hybrids from species in their natural state; and this probably
explains the singular difference in the results arrived at by
different observers. Thus Max Wichura doubts whether hybrids ever
revert to their parent forms, and he experimented on uncultivated
species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand, insists in the
strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to reversion in
hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants. Gartner
further states that when any two species, although most closely
allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids
are widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct
varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the
hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can
make out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly
opposed to the results of several experiments made by
Kolreuter.</p>
<p>Such alone are the unimportant differences which Gartner is able
to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand,
the degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to
their respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from
nearly related species, follow, according to Gartner the same laws.
When two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power
of impressing its likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be
with varieties of plants; and with animals, one variety certainly
often has this prepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants
produced from a reciprocal cross generally resemble each other
closely, and so it is with mongrel plants from a reciprocal cross.
Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent
form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with either
parent.</p>
<p>These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but
the subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence
of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to
prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one
sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with
another and when one variety is crossed with another variety. For
instance, I think those authors are right who maintain that the ass
has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the
hinny resemble more closely the ass than the horse; but that the
prepotency runs more strongly in the male than in the female ass,
so that the mule, which is an offspring of the male ass and mare,
is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is the offspring of
the female-ass and stallion.</p>
<p>Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact,
that it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not
intermediate in character, but closely resemble one of their
parents; but this does sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant
much less frequently than with mongrels. Looking to the cases which
I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one
parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost
monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appearedâ€”such as
albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional
fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters which have been
slowly acquired through selection. A tendency to sudden reversions
to the perfect character of either parent would, also, be much more
likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties
often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with
hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally
produced. On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas,
who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to
animals, comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of
the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents
differ little or much from each other, namely, in the union of
individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of
distinct species.</p>
<p>Independently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all
other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in
the offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we
look at species as having been specially created, and at varieties
as having been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be
an astonishing fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that
there is no essential distinction between species and
varieties.</p>
