<h3 class="section_title">2. Degrees Of Sterility</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their
hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and
works of those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter
and Gartner, who almost devoted their lives to this subject,
without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some
degree of sterility. Kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then
he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms,
considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile
together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. Gartner, also,
makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire
fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases. But in these and in many other
cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to
show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares the
maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed,
and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the
average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of
nature. But causes of serious error here intervene: a plant, to be
hybridised, must be castrated, and, what is often more important,
must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by
insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimented on by
Gartner were potted, and were kept in a chamber in his house. That
these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant
cannot be doubted; for Gartner gives in his table about a score of
cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised
with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the
Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the
manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility in
some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gartner repeatedly crossed some
forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels (Anagallis
arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as varieties,
and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many
species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he
believed.</p>
<p>It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various
species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away
so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure
species is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for
all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect
fertility ends and sterility begins. I think no better evidence of
this can be required than that the two most experienced observers
who have ever lived, namely Kolreuter and Gartner, arrived at
diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some of the very
same forms. It is also most instructive to compare—but I have not
space here to enter on details—the evidence advanced by our best
botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be
ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility
adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from
experiments made during different years. It can thus be shown that
neither sterility nor fertility affords any certain distinction
between species and varieties. The evidence from this source
graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the
evidence derived from other constitutional and structural
differences.</p>
<p>In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations;
though Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding
them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in
one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their
fertility never increases, but generally decreases greatly and
suddenly. With respect to this decrease, it may first be noticed
that when any deviation in structure or constitution is common to
both parents, this is often transmitted in an augmented degree to
the offspring; and both sexual elements in hybrid plants are
already affected in some degree. But I believe that their fertility
has been diminished in nearly all these cases by an independent
cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I have made so many
experiments and collected so many facts, showing on the one hand
that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety
increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on the
other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and
fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion.
Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and
as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in
the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented
during the flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves,
will generally be fertilised during each generation by pollen from
the same flower; and this would probably be injurious to their
fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am
strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement
repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile
hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same
kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects
from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on
increasing. Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen
is as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from
the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower
itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two
flowers, though probably often on the same plant, would be thus
effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in
progress, so careful an observer as Gartner would have castrated
his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross
with pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or
from another plant of the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange
fact of an increase of fertility in the successive generations of
ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those
spontaneously self- fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for
by too close interbreeding having been avoided.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most
experienced hybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is
as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly
fertile—as fertile as the pure parent-species—as are Kolreuter and
Gartner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a
universal law of nature. He experimented on some of the very same
species as did Gartner. The difference in their results may, I
think, be in part accounted for by Herbert's great horticultural
skill, and by his having hot-houses at his command. Of his many
important statements I will here give only a single one as an
example, namely, that "every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense
fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to
occur in a case of its natural fecundation." So that here we have
perfect, or even more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first
cross between two distinct species.</p>
<p>This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact,
namely, that individual plants of certain species of Lobelia,
Verbascum and Passiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen
from a distinct species, but not by pollen from the same plant,
though this pollen can be proved to be perfectly sound by
fertilising other plants or species. In the genus Hippeastrum, in
Corydalis as shown by Professor Hildebrand, in various orchids as
shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Muller, all the individuals are in
this peculiar condition. So that with some species, certain
abnormal individuals, and in other species all the individuals, can
actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be
fertilised by pollen from the same individual plant! To give one
instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers;
three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen, and the
fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound
hybrid descended from three distinct species: the result was that
"the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and
after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by
the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to
maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely." Mr. Herbert
tried similar experiments during many years, and always with the
same result. These cases serve to show on what slight and
mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a species
sometimes depends.</p>
<p>The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made
with scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in
how complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia,
Calceolaria, Petunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet
many of these hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts
that a hybrid from Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea,
species most widely dissimilar in general habit, "reproduces itself
as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains
of Chile." I have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of
fertility of some of the complex crosses of Rhododendrons, and I am
assured that many of them are perfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for
instance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a
hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and catawbiense, and that this hybrid
"seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine." Had hybrids, when
fairly treated, always gone on decreasing in fertility in each
successive generation, as Gartner believed to be the case, the fact
would have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise
large beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated,
for by insect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross
freely with each other, and the injurious influence of close
interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may readily convince
himself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers
of the more sterile kinds of hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no
pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought
from other flowers.</p>
<p>In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully
tried than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be
trusted, that is, if the genera of animals are as distinct from
each other as are the genera of plants, then we may infer that
animals more widely distinct in the scale of nature can be crossed
more easily than in the case of plants; but the hybrids themselves
are, I think, more sterile. It should, however, be borne in mind
that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few
experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird
has been crossed with nine distinct species of finches, but, as not
one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to
expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that
their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect to
the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid
animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the
same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different
parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On
the contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in
each successive generation, in opposition to the constantly
repeated admonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is not
at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should
have gone on increasing.</p>
<p>Although I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated
cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe
that the hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from
Phasianus colchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile. M.
Quatrefages states that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia
and arrindia) were proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight
generations. It has lately been asserted that two such distinct
species as the hare and rabbit, when they can be got to breed
together, produce offspring, which are highly fertile when crossed
with one of the parent-species. The hybrids from the common and
Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which are so different that
they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in
this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance
they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised
two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches; and
from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids
(grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however,
these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured
by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain
Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in
various parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit,
where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be
highly or perfectly fertile.</p>
<p>With our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed
together are quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended
from two or more wild species. From this fact we must conclude
either that the aboriginal parent-species at first produced
perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the hybrids subsequently reared
under domestication became quite fertile. This latter alternative,
which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by far the most
probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted. It is, for instance,
almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild
stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous
domestic dogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; but
analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal
species would at first have freely bred together and have produced
quite fertile hybrids. So again I have lately acquired decisive
evidence that the crossed offspring from the Indian humped and
common cattle are inter se perfectly fertile; and from the
observations by Rutimeyer on their important osteological
differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth on their
differences in habits, voice, constitution, etc., these two forms
must be regarded as good and distinct species. The same remarks may
be extended to the two chief races of the pig. We must, therefore,
either give up the belief of the universal sterility of species
when crossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals, not as
an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by
domestication.</p>
<p>Finally, considering all the ascertained facts on the
intercrossing of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some
degree of sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an
extremely general result; but that it cannot, under our present
state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal.</p>
