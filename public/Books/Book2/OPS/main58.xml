<h3 class="section_title">8. Utilitarian Doctrine, How Far True:
Beauty, How Acquired</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest
lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine
that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of
its possessor. They believe that many structures have been created
for the sake of beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this
latter point is beyond the scope of scientific discussion), or for
the sake of mere variety, a view already discussed. Such doctrines,
if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. I fully admit that
many structures are now of no direct use to their possessors, and
may never have been of any use to their progenitors; but this does
not prove that they were formed solely for beauty or variety. No
doubt the definite action of changed conditions, and the various
causes of modifications, lately specified, have all produced an
effect, probably a great effect, independently of any advantage
thus gained. But a still more important consideration is that the
chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due to
inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well
fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very
close and direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can
hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the
frigate- bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe
that the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of
the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal,
are of special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these
structures to inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful
to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as
they now are to the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe
that the progenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a
foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may
further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of
the monkey, horse and bat, were originally developed, on the
principle of utility, probably through the reduction of more
numerous bones in the fin of some ancient fish-like progenitor of
the whole class. It is scarcely possible to decide how much
allowance ought to be made for such causes of change, as the
definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous
variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these
important exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every
living creature either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or
indirect use to its possessor.</p>
<p>With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created
beautiful for the delight of man—a belief which it has been
pronounced is subversive of my whole theory—I may first remark that
the sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind,
irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that
the idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see
this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an
entirely different standard of beauty in their women. If beautiful
objects had been created solely for man's gratification, it ought
to be shown that before man appeared there was less beauty on the
face of the earth than since he came on the stage. Were the
beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene epoch, and the
gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period, created
that man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few
objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the
diatomaceae: were these created that they might be examined and
admired under the higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in
this latter case, and in many others, is apparently wholly due to
symmetry of growth. Flowers rank among the most beautiful
productions of nature; but they have been rendered conspicuous in
contrast with the green leaves, and in consequence at the same time
beautiful, so that they may be easily observed by insects. I have
come to this conclusion from finding it an invariable rule that
when a flower is fertilised by the wind it never has a
gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually produce two kinds
of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to attract insects;
the other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar, and never
visited by insects. Hence, we may conclude that, if insects had not
been developed on the face of the earth, our plants would not have
been decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only
such poor flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on
grasses, spinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised
through the agency of the wind. A similar line of argument holds
good with fruits; that a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing
to the eye as to the palate—that the gaily-coloured fruit of the
spindle-wood tree and the scarlet berries of the holly are
beautiful objects—will be admitted by everyone. But this beauty
serves merely as a guide to birds and beasts, in order that the
fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds disseminated. I infer
that this is the case from having as yet found no exception to the
rule that seeds are always thus disseminated when embedded within a
fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or pulpy envelope), if
it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered conspicuous by
being white or black.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male
animals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and
mammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have
been rendered beautiful for beauty's sake. But this has been
effected through sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful
males having been continually preferred by the females, and not for
the delight of man. So it is with the music of birds. We may infer
from all this that a nearly similar taste for beautiful colours and
for musical sounds runs through a large part of the animal kingdom.
When the female is as beautifully coloured as the male, which is
not rarely the case with birds and butterflies, the cause
apparently lies in the colours acquired through sexual selection
having been transmitted to both sexes, instead of to the males
alone. How the sense of beauty in its simplest form—that is, the
reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours,
forms and sounds—was first developed in the mind of man and of the
lower animals, is a very obscure subject. The same sort of
difficulty is presented if we enquire how it is that certain
flavours and odours give pleasure, and others displeasure. Habit in
all these cases appears to have come to a certain extent into play;
but there must be some fundamental cause in the constitution of the
nervous system in each species.</p>
<p>Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a
species exclusively for the good of another species; though
throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and
profits by the structures of others. But natural selection can and
does often produce structures for the direct injury of other
animals, as we see in the fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor
of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited in the living
bodies of other insects. If it could be proved that any part of the
structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good
of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could
not have been produced through natural selection. Although many
statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect,
I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It is
admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence
and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that
at the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury,
namely, to warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that the
cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to
warn the doomed mouse. It is a much more probable view that the
rattlesnake uses its rattle, the cobra expands its frill and the
puff-adder swells while hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to
alarm the many birds and beasts which are known to attack even the
most venomous species. Snakes act on the same principle which makes
the hen ruffle her feathers and expand her wings when a dog
approaches her chickens. But I have not space here to enlarge on
the many ways by which animals endeavour to frighten away their
enemies.</p>
<p>Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure
more injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection
acts solely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed,
as Paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing
an injury to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the
good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the whole
advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of
life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if
it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become
extinct.</p>
<p>Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as
perfect as, or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of
the same country with which it comes into competition. And we see
that this is the standard of perfection attained under nature. The
endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one
compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the
advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe.
Natural selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we
always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high standard under
nature. The correction for the aberration of light is said by
Muller not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the human
eye. Helmholtz, whose judgment no one will dispute, after
describing in the strongest terms the wonderful powers of the human
eye, adds these remarkable words: "That which we have discovered in
the way of inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and
in the image on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the
incongruities which we have just come across in the domain of the
sensations. One might say that nature has taken delight in
accumulating contradictions in order to remove all foundation from
the theory of a pre-existing harmony between the external and
internal worlds." If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm
a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason
tells us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other
contrivances are less perfect. Can we consider the sting of the bee
as perfect, which, when used against many kinds of enemies, cannot
be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and thus inevitably
causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera?</p>
<p>If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a
remote progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that
in so many members of the same great order, and that it has since
been modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the
poison originally adapted for some other object, such as to produce
galls, since intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that
the use of the sting should so often cause the insect's own death:
for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the social
community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural
selection, though it may cause the death of some few members. If we
admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of
many insects find their females, can we admire the production for
this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly
useless to the community for any other purpose, and which are
ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It
may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive
hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the young
queens, her daughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish
herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the
community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter
fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable
principles of natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious
contrivances by which orchids and many other plants are fertilised
through insect agency, can we consider as equally perfect the
elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so that a
few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?</p>
