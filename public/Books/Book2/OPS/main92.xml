<h3 class="section_title">6. On The Succession Of The Same Types
Within The Same Areas, During The Later Tertiary Periods</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the
Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of
that continent. In South America, a similar relationship is
manifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of
armour, like those of the armadillo, found in several parts of La
Plata; and Professor Owen has shown in the most striking manner
that most of the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are
related to South American types. This relationship is even more
clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by
MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much
impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and
1845, on this "law of the succession of types,"â€”on "this wonderful
relationship in the same continent between the dead and the
living." Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same
generalisation to the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law
in this author's restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of
New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil.
Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with
sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution of most molluscs, it is
not well displayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the
relation between the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and
between the extinct and living brackish water-shells of the
Aralo-Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>Now, what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same
types within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after
comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts of South
America, under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the
one hand through dissimilar physical conditions, for the
dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents; and, on
the other hand through similarity of conditions, for the uniformity
of the same types in each continent during the later tertiary
periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that
marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in
Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should have
been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in
ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown
in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of
distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from
what it now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the
present character of the southern half of the continent; and the
southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at
present, to the northern half. In a similar manner we know, from
Falconer and Cautley's discoveries, that Northern India was
formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is
at the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation to
the distribution of marine animals.</p>
<p>On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the
long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types
within the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of
each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that
quarter, during the next succeeding period of time, closely allied
though in some degree modified descendants. If the inhabitants of
one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another
continent, so will their modified descendants still differ in
nearly the same manner and degree. But after very long intervals of
time, and after great geographical changes, permitting much
intermigration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms,
and there will be nothing immutable in the distribution of organic
beings.</p>
<p>It may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the
megatherium and other allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in
South America, have left behind them the sloth, armadillo, and
anteater, as their degenerate descendants. This cannot for an
instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly extinct,
and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil there are many
extinct species which are closely allied in size and in all other
characters to the species still living in South America; and some
of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors of the living
species. It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all the
species of the same genus are the descendants of some one species;
so that, if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one
geological formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six
other allied or representative genera, each with the same number of
species, then we may conclude that generally only one species of
each of the older genera has left modified descendants, which
constitute the new genera containing the several species; the other
seven species of each old genus having died out and left no
progeny. Or, and this will be a far commoner case, two or three
species in two or three alone of the six older genera will be the
parents of the new genera: the other species and the other old
genera having become utterly extinct. In failing orders, with the
genera and species decreasing in numbers as is the case with the
Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will
leave modified blood-descendants.</p>
