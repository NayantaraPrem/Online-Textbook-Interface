<h3 class="section_title">7. Divergence Of Character</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high
importance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In
the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though
having somewhat of the character of species—as is shown by the
hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them—yet certainly differ
far less from each other than do good and distinct species.
Nevertheless according to my view, varieties are species in the
process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient
species. How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties
become augmented into the greater difference between species? That
this does habitually happen, we must infer from most of the
innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked
differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents
of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined
differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one
variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the
offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the
very same character and in a greater degree; but this alone would
never account for so habitual and large a degree of difference as
that between the species of the same genus.</p>
<p>As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head
from our domestic productions. We shall here find something
analogous. It will be admitted that the production of races so
different as short-horn and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses,
the several breeds of pigeons, etc., could never have been effected
by the mere chance accumulation of similar variations during many
successive generations. In practice, a fancier is, for instance,
struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier
is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the
acknowledged principle that "fanciers do not and will not admire a
medium standard, but like extremes," they both go on (as has
actually occurred with the sub-breeds of the tumbler-pigeon)
choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks, or
with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at an
early period of history, the men of one nation or district required
swifter horses, while those of another required stronger and
bulkier horses. The early differences would be very slight; but, in
the course of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses
in the one case, and of stronger ones in the other, the differences
would become greater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds.
Ultimately after the lapse of centuries, these sub-breeds would
become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds. As
the differences became greater, the inferior animals with
intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong,
would not have been used for breeding, and will thus have tended to
disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions the action of
what may be called the principle of divergence, causing
differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and
the breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from
their common parent.</p>
<p>But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in
nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it
was a long time before I saw how), from the simple circumstance
that the more diversified the descendants from any one species
become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they
be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in
the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.</p>
<p>We can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple
habits. Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the
number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at
its full average. If its natural power of increase be allowed to
act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any
change in conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on
places at present occupied by other animals: some of them, for
instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead
or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting
water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more
diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our
carnivorous animals become, the more places they will be enabled to
occupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time
to all animals—that is, if they vary—for otherwise natural
selection can effect nothing. So it will be with plants. It has
been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with
one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several
distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a
greater weight of dry herbage can be raised in the latter than in
the former case. The same has been found to hold good when one
variety and several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on
equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to
go on varying, and the varieties were continually selected which
differed from each other in the same manner, though in a very
slight degree, as do the distinct species and genera of grasses, a
greater number of individual plants of this species, including its
modified descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of
ground. And we know that each species and each variety of grass is
annually sowing almost countless seeds; and is thus striving, as it
may be said, to the utmost to increase in number. Consequently, in
the course of many thousand generations, the most distinct
varieties of any one species of grass would have the best chance of
succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting
the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very
distinct from each other, take the rank of species.</p>
<p>The truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can
be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under
many natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially
if freely open to immigration, and where the contest between
individual and individual must be very severe, we always find great
diversity in its inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of
turf, three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for many
years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of
plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders,
which shows how much these plants differed from each other. So it
is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets: also in
small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise more
food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different
orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation.
Most of the animals and plants which live close round any small
piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be
in any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost
to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the
closest competition, the advantages of diversification of
structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and
constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle
each other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what
we call different genera and orders.</p>
<p>The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants
through man's agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected
that the plants which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any
land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for
these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for
their own country. It might also, perhaps, have been expected that
naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more
especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. But the
case is very different; and Alph. de Candolle has well remarked, in
his great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation,
proportionally with the number of the native genera and species,
far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single
instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's "Manual of the
Flora of the Northern United States," 260 naturalised plants are
enumerated, and these belong to 162 genera. We thus see that these
naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature. They differ,
moreover, to a large extent, from the indigenes, for out of the 162
naturalised genera, no less than 100 genera are not there
indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the
genera now living in the United States.</p>
<p>By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in
any country struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have
there become naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what
manner some of the natives would have had to be modified in order
to gain an advantage over their compatriots; and we may at least
infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic
differences, would be profitable to them.</p>
<p>The advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants
of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the
physiological division of labour in the organs of the same
individual body—a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards. No
physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest
vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from
these substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more
widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for
different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals
be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of animals, with
their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete
with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be
doubted, for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are
divided into groups differing but little from each other, and
feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked,
our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully
compete with these well-developed orders. In the Australian
mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early and
incomplete stage of development.</p>
