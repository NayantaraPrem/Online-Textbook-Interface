<p>During a discussion of the results obtained at a joint meeting
of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society held
especially for that purpose recently in London, it was the general
opinion that Einstein's prediction might be regarded as justified,
and warm tributes to his genius were made on all sides.
Nevertheless, I cannot refrain, while I am mentioning it, from
expressing my surprise that, according to the report
in&#160;<em>The Times</em>&#160;there should be so much complaint
about the difficulty of understanding the new theory. It is evident
that Einstein's little book “About the Special and the General
Theory of Relativity in Plain Terms,” did not find its way into
England during wartime. Any one reading it will, in my opinion,
come to the conclusion that the basic ideas of the theory are
really clear and simple; it is only to be regretted that it was
impossible to avoid clothing them in pretty involved mathematical
terms, but we must not worry about that.</p>
<p>I allow myself to add that, as we follow Einstein, we may retain
much of what has been formerly gained. The Newtonian theory remains
in its full value as the first great step, without which one cannot
imagine the development of astronomy and without which the second
step, that has now been made, would hardly have been possible. It
remains, moreover, as the first, and in most cases, sufficient,
approximation. It is true that, according to Einstein's theory,
because it leaves us entirely free as to the way in which we wish
to represent the phenomena, we can imagine an idea of the solar
system in which the planets follow paths of peculiar form and the
rays of light shine along sharply bent lines—think of a twisted and
distorted planetarium—but in every case where we apply it to
concrete questions we shall so arrange it that the planets describe
almost exact ellipses and the rays of light almost straight
lines.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to give up entirely even the ether. Many
natural philosophers find satisfaction in the idea of a material
intermediate substance in which the vibrations of light take place,
and they will very probably be all the more inclined to imagine
such a medium when they learn that, according to the Einstein
theory, gravitation itself does not spread instantaneously, but
with a velocity that at the first estimate may be compared with
that of light. Especially in former years were such interpretations
current and repeated attempts were made by speculations about the
nature of the ether and about the mutations and movements that
might take place in it to arrive at a clear presentation of
electro-magnetic phenomena, and also of the functioning of
gravitation. In my opinion it is not impossible that in the future
this road, indeed abandoned at present, will once more be followed
with good results, if only because it can lead to the thinking out
of new experimental tests. Einstein's theory need not keep us from
so doing; only the ideas about the ether must accord with it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even without the color and clearness that the
ether theories and the other models may be able to give, and even,
we can feel it this way, just because of the soberness induced by
their absence, Einstein's work, we may now positively expect, will
remain a monument of science; his theory entirely fulfills the
first and principal demand that we may make, that of deducing the
course of phenomena from certain principles exactly and to the
smallest details. It was certainly fortunate that he himself put
the ether in the background; if he had not done so, he probably
would never have come upon the idea that has been the foundation of
all his examinations.</p>
<p>Thanks to his indefatigable exertions and perseverance, for he
had great difficulties to overcome in his attempts, Einstein has
attained the results, which I have tried to sketch, while still
young; he is now 45 years old. He completed his first
investigations in Switzerland, where he first was engaged in the
Patent Bureau at Berne and later as a professor at the Polytechnic
in Zurich. After having been a professor for a short time at the
University of Prague, he settled in Berlin, where the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute afforded him the opportunity to devote himself
exclusively to his scientific work. He repeatedly visited our
country and made his Netherland colleagues, among whom he counts
many good friends, partners in his studies and his results. He
attended the last meeting of the department of natural philosophy
of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and the members then had the
privilege of hearing him explain, in his own fascinating, clear and
simple way, his interpretations of the fundamental questions to
which his theory gives rise.</p>
