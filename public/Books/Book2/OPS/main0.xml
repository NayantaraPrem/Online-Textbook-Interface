<p>"But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so
far as this— we can perceive that events are brought about not by
insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each
particular case, but by the establishment of general
laws."—Whewell: "Bridgewater Treatise".</p>
<p>"The only distinct meaning of the word 'natural' is STATED,
FIXED or SETTLED; since what is natural as much requires and
presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, i.e., to effect
it continually or at stated times, as what is supernatural or
miraculous does to effect it for once."—Butler: "Analogy of
Revealed Religion".</p>
<p>"To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of
sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a
man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God's
word, or in the book of God's works; divinity or philosophy; but
rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in
both."—Bacon: "Advancement of Learning".</p>
