<h3 class="section_title">10. Convergence Of Character</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Mr. H.C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of
divergence of character (in which, however, he apparently
believes), and that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise
played a part. If two species belonging to two distinct though
allied genera, had both produced a large number of new and
divergent forms, it is conceivable that these might approach each
other so closely that they would have all to be classed under the
same genus; and thus the descendants of two distinct genera would
converge into one. But it would in most cases be extremely rash to
attribute to convergence a close and general similarity of
structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct forms. The
shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular forces,
and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should
sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should
bear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of
complex relations, namely on the variations which have arisen,
these being due to causes far too intricate to be followed out—on
the nature of the variations which have been preserved or selected,
and this depends on the surrounding physical conditions, and in a
still higher degree on the surrounding organisms with which each
being has come into competition—and lastly, on inheritance (in
itself a fluctuating element) from innumerable progenitors, all of
which have had their forms determined through equally complex
relations. It is incredible that the descendants of two organisms,
which had originally differed in a marked manner, should ever
afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near approach to
identity throughout their whole organisation. If this had occurred,
we should meet with the same form, independently of genetic
connection, recurring in widely separated geological formations;
and the balance of evidence is opposed to any such an
admission.</p>
<p>Mr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of
natural selection, together with divergence of character, would
tend to make an indefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere
inorganic conditions are concerned, it seems probable that a
sufficient number of species would soon become adapted to all
considerable diversities of heat, moisture, etc.; but I fully admit
that the mutual relations of organic beings are more important; and
as the number of species in any country goes on increasing, the
organic conditions of life must become more and more complex.
Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount of
profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to
the number of species which might be produced. We do not know that
even the most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms:
at the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an
astonishing number of species, many European plants have become
naturalised. But geology shows us, that from an early part of the
tertiary period the number of species of shells, and that from the
middle part of this same period, the number of mammals has not
greatly or at all increased. What then checks an indefinite
increase in the number of species? The amount of life (I do not
mean the number of specific forms) supported on an area must have a
limit, depending so largely as it does on physical conditions;
therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species, each or
nearly each species will be represented by few individuals; and
such species will be liable to extermination from accidental
fluctuations in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their
enemies. The process of extermination in such cases would be rapid,
whereas the production of new species must always be slow. Imagine
the extreme case of as many species as individuals in England, and
the first severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate
thousands on thousands of species. Rare species, and each species
will become rare if the number of species in any country becomes
indefinitely increased, will, on the principal often explained,
present within a given period few favourable variations;
consequently, the process of giving birth to new specific forms
would thus be retarded. When any species becomes very rare, close
interbreeding will help to exterminate it; authors have thought
that this comes into play in accounting for the deterioration of
the aurochs in Lithuania, of red deer in Scotland and of bears in
Norway, etc. Lastly, and this I am inclined to think is the most
important element, a dominant species, which has already beaten
many competitors in its own home, will tend to spread and supplant
many others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those species which
spread widely tend generally to spread VERY widely, consequently
they will tend to supplant and exterminate several species in
several areas, and thus check the inordinate increase of specific
forms throughout the world. Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in
the southeast corner of Australia, where, apparently, there are
many invaders from different quarters of the globe, the endemic
Australian species have been greatly reduced in number. How much
weight to attribute to these several considerations I will not
pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each country the
tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.</p>
