möchte gerne etwas geniessen ohne 'Kosten' zu haben." A a pun upon
the word "kosten," which has two meanings—"taste" and "cost." In
"Die Traumdeutung," third edition, p. 71 footnote, Professor Freud
remarks that "the finest example of dream interpretation left us by
the ancients is based upon a pun" (from "The Interpretation of
Dreams," by Artemidorus Daldianus). "Moreover, dreams are so
intimately bound up with language that Ferenczi truly points out
that every tongue has its own language of dreams. A dream is as a
rule untranslatable into other languages."—TRANSLATOR.</span></div>

"main2.xml#footnote_2_call">[2]</a> <span class="isfootnote">It is
worthy of remark that eminent philologists maintain that the oldest
languages used the same word for expressing quite general
antitheses. In C. Abel's essay, "Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworter"
(1884, the following examples of such words in England are given:
"gleam—gloom"; "to lock—loch"; "down—The Downs"; "to step—to stop."
In his essay on "The Origin of Language" ("Linguistic Essays," p.
240), Abel says: "When the Englishman says 'without,' is not his
judgment based upon the comparative juxtaposition of two opposites,
'with' and 'out'; 'with' itself originally meant 'without,' as may
still be seen in 'withdraw.' 'Bid' includes the opposite sense of
giving and of proffering." Abel, "The English Verbs of Command,"
"Linguistic Essays," p. 104; see also Freud, "Ueber den Gegensinn
der Urworte"; Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und
Psychopathologische Forschungen, Band II., part i., p.
179).—TRANSLATOR.</span></div>

myself regret the introduction of such passages from the
psychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary
representation and of being torn from all connection with the
subject, cannot have a very enlightening influence. If these
passages are capable of throwing light upon the intimate relations
between the dream and the psychoneuroses, they have served the
purpose for which I have taken them up.</span></div>

is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of
fancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They
contain the explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people
of being buried alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious
reason for the belief in a life after death which represents
nothing but a projection into the future of this mysterious life
before birth. The act of birth, moreover, is the first experience
with fear, and is thus the source and model of the emotion of
fear.</span></div>

share this character of indestructibility with all psychic acts
that are really unconscious—that is, with psychic acts belonging to
the system of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open
and never fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the
exciting process as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious
excitement To speak metaphorically they suffer the same form of
annihilation as the shades of the lower region in the Odyssey, who
awoke to new life the moment they drank blood. The processes
depending on the foreconscious system are destructible in a
different way. The psychotherapy of the neuroses is based on this
difference.</span></div>

"isfootnote">Here, as in other places, there are gaps in the
treatment of the subject, which I have left intentionally, because
to fill them up would require on the one hand too great effort, and
on the other hand an extensive reference to material that is
foreign to the dream. Thus I have avoided stating whether I connect
with the word "suppressed" another sense than with the word
"repressed." It has been made clear only that the latter emphasizes
more than the former the relation to the unconscious. I have not
entered into the cognate problem why the dream thoughts also
experience distortion by the censor when they abandon the
progressive continuation to consciousness and choose the path of
regression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an interest in
the problems to which the further analysis of the dreamwork leads
and to indicate the other themes which meet these on the way. It
was not always easy to decide just where the pursuit should be
discontinued. That I have not treated exhaustively the part played
in the dream by the psychosexual life and have avoided the
interpretation of dreams of an obvious sexual content is due to a
special reason which may not come up to the reader's expectation.
To be sure, it is very far from my ideas and the principles
expressed by me in neuropathology to regard the sexual life as a
"pudendum" which should be left unconsidered by the physician and
the scientific investigator. I also consider ludicrous the moral
indignation which prompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis
to keep from the reader's knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams
contained in the Symbolism of the Dreams. As for myself, I have
been actuated solely by the conviction that in the explanation of
sexual dreams I should be bound to entangle myself deeply in the
still unexplained problems of perversion and bisexuality; and for
that reason I have reserved this material for another
connection.</span></div>
