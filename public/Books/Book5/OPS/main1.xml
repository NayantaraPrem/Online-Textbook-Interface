Dreams have a meaning</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>In what we may term "prescientific days" people were in no
uncertainty about the interpretation of dreams. When they were
recalled after awakening they were regarded as either the friendly
or hostile manifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and
Divine. With the rise of scientific thought the whole of this
expressive mythology was transferred to psychology; to-day there is
but a small minority among educated persons who doubt that the
dream is the dreamer's own psychical act.</p>
<p>But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an
interpretation of the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its
origin; its relationship to our psychical life when we are awake;
its independence of disturbances which, during the state of sleep,
seem to compel notice; its many peculiarities repugnant to our
waking thought; the incongruence between its images and the
feelings they engender; then the dream's evanescence, the way in
which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something
bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or rejecting it—all these
and many other problems have for many hundred years demanded
answers which up till now could never have been satisfactory.
Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the dream, a
question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly, the
psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to
the psychical processes, as to a possible biological function;
secondly, has the dream a meaning—can sense be made of each single
dream as of other mental syntheses?</p>
<p>Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams.
Many philosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies,
one which at the same time preserves something of the dream's
former over-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a
peculiar state of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as
elevation to some higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims:
"The dream is the liberation of the spirit from the pressure of
external nature, a detachment of the soul from the fetters of
matter." Not all go so far as this, but many maintain that dreams
have their origin in real spiritual excitations, and are the
outward manifestations of spiritual powers whose free movements
have been hampered during the day ("Dream Phantasies," Scherner,
Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledge that dream life
is capable of extraordinary achievements—at any rate, in certain
fields ("Memory").</p>
<p>In striking contradiction with this the majority of medical
writers hardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at
all. According to them dreams are provoked and initiated
exclusively by stimuli proceeding from the senses or the body,
which either reach the sleeper from without or are accidental
disturbances of his internal organs. The dream has no greater claim
to meaning and importance than the sound called forth by the ten
fingers of a person quite unacquainted with music running his
fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream is to be
regarded, says Binz, "as a physical process always useless,
frequently morbid." All the peculiarities of dream life are
explicable as the incoherent effort, due to some physiological
stimulus, of certain organs, or of the cortical elements of a brain
otherwise asleep.</p>
<p>But slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to
the origin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief
that dreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell
the future, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or
other from its oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The reading of
dreams consists in replacing the events of the dream, so far as
remembered, by other events. This is done either scene by scene,
according to some rigid key, or the dream as a whole is replaced by
something else of which it was a symbol. Serious-minded persons
laugh at these efforts—"Dreams are but sea-foam!"</p>
<p>One day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view
grounded in superstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to
the truth about dreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams
by the use of a new method of psychological investigation, one
which had rendered me good service in the investigation of phobias,
obsessions, illusions, and the like, and which, under the name
"psycho-analysis," had found acceptance by a whole school of
investigators. The manifold analogies of dream life with the most
diverse conditions of psychical disease in the waking state have
been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers. It
seemed, therefore, a priori, hopeful to apply to the interpretation
of dreams methods of investigation which had been tested in
psychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar
sensations of haunting dread remain as strange to normal
consciousness as do dreams to our waking consciousness; their
origin is as unknown to consciousness as is that of dreams. It was
practical ends that impelled us, in these diseases, to fathom their
origin and formation. Experience had shown us that a cure and a
consequent mastery of the obsessing ideas did result when once
those thoughts, the connecting links between the morbid ideas and
the rest of the psychical content, were revealed which were
heretofore veiled from consciousness. The procedure I employed for
the interpretation of dreams thus arose from psychotherapy.</p>
<p>This procedure is readily described, although its practice
demands instruction and experience. Suppose the patient is
suffering from intense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his
attention to the idea in question, without, however, as he has so
frequently done, meditating upon it. Every impression about it,
without any exception, which occurs to him should be imparted to
the doctor. The statement which will be perhaps then made, that he
cannot concentrate his attention upon anything at all, is to be
countered by assuring him most positively that such a blank state
of mind is utterly impossible. As a matter of fact, a great number
of impressions will soon occur, with which others will associate
themselves. These will be invariably accompanied by the expression
of the observer's opinion that they have no meaning or are
unimportant. It will be at once noticed that it is this
self-criticism which prevented the patient from imparting the
ideas, which had indeed already excluded them from consciousness.
If the patient can be induced to abandon this self-criticism and to
pursue the trains of thought which are yielded by concentrating the
attention, most significant matter will be obtained, matter which
will be presently seen to be clearly linked to the morbid idea in
question. Its connection with other ideas will be manifest, and
later on will permit the replacement of the morbid idea by a fresh
one, which is perfectly adapted to psychical continuity.</p>
<p>This is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon
which this experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from
its invariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain
matter enough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we
especially direct our attention to the unbidden associations which
disturb our thoughts—those which are otherwise put aside by the
critic as worthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on
oneself, the best plan of helping the experiment is to write down
at once all one's first indistinct fancies.</p>
<p>I will now point out where this method leads when I apply it to
the examination of dreams. Any dream could be made use of in this
way. From certain motives I, however, choose a dream of my own,
which appears confused and meaningless to my memory, and one which
has the advantage of brevity. Probably my dream of last night
satisfies the requirements. Its content, fixed immediately after
awakening, runs as follows:</p>
<p>"Company; at table or table d'hôte… . Spinach is served. Mrs.
E.L., sitting next to me, gives me her undivided attention, and
places her hand familiarly upon my knee. In defence I remove her
hand. Then she says: 'But you have always had such beautiful
eyes.'… . I then distinctly see something like two eyes as a sketch
or as the contour of a spectacle lens… ."</p>
<p>This is the whole dream, or, at all events, all that I can
remember. It appears to me not only obscure and meaningless, but
more especially odd. Mrs. E.L. is a person with whom I am scarcely
on visiting terms, nor to my knowledge have I ever desired any more
cordial relationship. I have not seen her for a long time, and do
not think there was any mention of her recently. No emotion
whatever accompanied the dream process.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon this dream does not make it a bit clearer to my
mind. I will now, however, present the ideas, without premeditation
and without criticism, which introspection yielded. I soon notice
that it is an advantage to break up the dream into its elements,
and to search out the ideas which link themselves to each
fragment.</p>
<p>Company; at table or table d'hôte. The recollection of the
slight event with which the evening of yesterday ended is at once
called up. I left a small party in the company of a friend, who
offered to drive me home in his cab. "I prefer a taxi," he said;
"that gives one such a pleasant occupation; there is always
something to look at." When we were in the cab, and the cab-driver
turned the disc so that the first sixty hellers were visible, I
continued the jest. "We have hardly got in and we already owe sixty
hellers. The taxi always reminds me of the table d'hôte. It makes
me avaricious and selfish by continuously reminding me of my debt.
It seems to me to mount up too quickly, and I am always afraid that
I shall be at a disadvantage, just as I cannot resist at table
d'hôte the comical fear that I am getting too little, that I must
look after myself." In far-fetched connection with this I
quote:</p>
<p>"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,</p>
<p>To guilt ye let us heedless go."</p>
<p>Another idea about the table d'hôte. A few weeks ago I was very
cross with my dear wife at the dinner-table at a Tyrolese health
resort, because she was not sufficiently reserved with some
neighbors with whom I wished to have absolutely nothing to do. I
begged her to occupy herself rather with me than with the
strangers. That is just as if I had been at a disadvantage at the
table d'hôte. The contrast between the behavior of my wife at the
table and that of Mrs. E.L. in the dream now strikes me: "Addresses
herself entirely to me."</p>
<p>Further, I now notice that the dream is the reproduction of a
little scene which transpired between my wife and myself when I was
secretly courting her. The caressing under cover of the tablecloth
was an answer to a wooer's passionate letter. In the dream,
however, my wife is replaced by the unfamiliar E.L.</p>
<p>Mrs. E.L. is the daughter of a man to whom I owed money! I
cannot help noticing that here there is revealed an unsuspected
connection between the dream content and my thoughts. If the chain
of associations be followed up which proceeds from one element of
the dream one is soon led back to another of its elements. The
thoughts evoked by the dream stir up associations which were not
noticeable in the dream itself.</p>
<p>Is it not customary, when some one expects others to look after
his interests without any advantage to themselves, to ask the
innocent question satirically: "Do you think this will be done for
the sake of your beautiful eyes?" Hence Mrs. E.L.'s speech in the
dream. "You have always had such beautiful eyes," means nothing but
"people always do everything to you for love of you; you have had
everything for nothing." The contrary is, of course, the truth; I
have always paid dearly for whatever kindness others have shown me.
Still, the fact that I had a ride for nothing yesterday when my
friend drove me home in his cab must have made an impression upon
me.</p>
<p>In any case, the friend whose guests we were yesterday has often
made me his debtor. Recently I allowed an opportunity of requiting
him to go by. He has had only one present from me, an antique
shawl, upon which eyes are painted all round, a so-called Occhiale,
as a charm against the Malocchio. Moreover, he is an eye
specialist. That same evening I had asked him after a patient whom
I had sent to him for glasses.</p>
<p>As I remarked, nearly all parts of the dream have been brought
into this new connection. I still might ask why in the dream it was
spinach that was served up. Because spinach called up a little
scene which recently occurred at our table. A child, whose
beautiful eyes are really deserving of praise, refused to eat
spinach. As a child I was just the same; for a long time I loathed
spinach, until in later life my tastes altered, and it became one
of my favorite dishes. The mention of this dish brings my own
childhood and that of my child's near together. "You should be glad
that you have some spinach," his mother had said to the little
gourmet. "Some children would be very glad to get spinach." Thus I
am reminded of the parents' duties towards their children. Goethe's
words—</p>
<p>"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,</p>
<p>To guilt ye let us heedless go"—</p>
<p>take on another meaning in this connection.</p>
<p>Here I will stop in order that I may recapitulate the results of
the analysis of the dream. By following the associations which were
linked to the single elements of the dream torn from their context,
I have been led to a series of thoughts and reminiscences where I
am bound to recognize interesting expressions of my psychical life.
The matter yielded by an analysis of the dream stands in intimate
relationship with the dream content, but this relationship is so
special that I should never have been able to have inferred the new
discoveries directly from the dream itself. The dream was
passionless, disconnected, and unintelligible. During the time that
I am unfolding the thoughts at the back of the dream I feel intense
and well-grounded emotions. The thoughts themselves fit beautifully
together into chains logically bound together with certain central
ideas which ever repeat themselves. Such ideas not represented in
the dream itself are in this instance the antitheses selfish,
unselfish, to be indebted, to work for nothing. I could draw closer
the threads of the web which analysis has disclosed, and would then
be able to show how they all run together into a single knot; I am
debarred from making this work public by considerations of a
private, not of a scientific, nature. After having cleared up many
things which I do not willingly acknowledge as mine, I should have
much to reveal which had better remain my secret. Why, then, do not
I choose another dream whose analysis would be more suitable for
publication, so that I could awaken a fairer conviction of the
sense and cohesion of the results disclosed by analysis? The answer
is, because every dream which I investigate leads to the same
difficulties and places me under the same need of discretion; nor
should I forgo this difficulty any the more were I to analyze the
dream of some one else. That could only be done when opportunity
allowed all concealment to be dropped without injury to those who
trusted me.</p>
<p>The conclusion which is now forced upon me is that the dream is
a sort of substitution for those emotional and intellectual trains
of thought which I attained after complete analysis. I do not yet
know the process by which the dream arose from those thoughts, but
I perceive that it is wrong to regard the dream as psychically
unimportant, a purely physical process which has arisen from the
activity of isolated cortical elements awakened out of sleep.</p>
<p>I must further remark that the dream is far shorter than the
thoughts which I hold it replaces; whilst analysis discovered that
the dream was provoked by an unimportant occurrence the evening
before the dream.</p>
<p>Naturally, I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions if
only one analysis were known to me. Experience has shown me that
when the associations of any dream are honestly followed such a
chain of thought is revealed, the constituent parts of the dream
reappear correctly and sensibly linked together; the slight
suspicion that this concatenation was merely an accident of a
single first observation must, therefore, be absolutely
relinquished. I regard it, therefore, as my right to establish this
new view by a proper nomenclature. I contrast the dream which my
memory evokes with the dream and other added matter revealed by
analysis: the former I call the dream's manifest content; the
latter, without at first further subdivision, its latent content. I
arrive at two new problems hitherto unformulated: (1) What is the
psychical process which has transformed the latent content of the
dream into its manifest content? (2) What is the motive or the
motives which have made such transformation exigent? The process by
which the change from latent to manifest content is executed I name
the dream-work. In contrast with this is the work of analysis,
which produces the reverse transformation. The other problems of
the dream—the inquiry as to its stimuli, as to the source of its
materials, as to its possible purpose, the function of dreaming,
the forgetting of dreams—these I will discuss in connection with
the latent dream-content.</p>
<p>I shall take every care to avoid a confusion between the
manifest and the latent content, for I ascribe all the
contradictory as well as the incorrect accounts of dream-life to
the ignorance of this latent content, now first laid bare through
analysis.</p>
<p>The conversion of the latent dream thoughts into those manifest
deserves our close study as the first known example of the
transformation of psychical stuff from one mode of expression into
another. From a mode of expression which, moreover, is readily
intelligible into another which we can only penetrate by effort and
with guidance, although this new mode must be equally reckoned as
an effort of our own psychical activity. From the standpoint of the
relationship of latent to manifest dream-content, dreams can be
divided into three classes. We can, in the first place, distinguish
those dreams which have a meaning and are, at the same time,
intelligible, which allow us to penetrate into our psychical life
without further ado. Such dreams are numerous; they are usually
short, and, as a general rule, do not seem very noticeable, because
everything remarkable or exciting surprise is absent. Their
occurrence is, moreover, a strong argument against the doctrine
which derives the dream from the isolated activity of certain
cortical elements. All signs of a lowered or subdivided psychical
activity are wanting. Yet we never raise any objection to
characterizing them as dreams, nor do we confound them with the
products of our waking life.</p>
<p>A second group is formed by those dreams which are indeed
self-coherent and have a distinct meaning, but appear strange
because we are unable to reconcile their meaning with our mental
life. That is the case when we dream, for instance, that some dear
relative has died of plague when we know of no ground for
expecting, apprehending, or assuming anything of the sort; we can
only ask ourself wonderingly: "What brought that into my head?" To
the third group those dreams belong which are void of both meaning
and intelligibility; they are incoherent, complicated, and
meaningless. The overwhelming number of our dreams partake of this
character, and this has given rise to the contemptuous attitude
towards dreams and the medical theory of their limited psychical
activity. It is especially in the longer and more complicated
dream-plots that signs of incoherence are seldom missing.</p>
<p>The contrast between manifest and latent dream-content is
clearly only of value for the dreams of the second and more
especially for those of the third class. Here are problems which
are only solved when the manifest dream is replaced by its latent
content; it was an example of this kind, a complicated and
unintelligible dream, that we subjected to analysis. Against our
expectation we, however, struck upon reasons which prevented a
complete cognizance of the latent dream thought. On the repetition
of this same experience we were forced to the supposition that
there is an intimate bond, with laws of its own, between the
unintelligible and complicated nature of the dream and the
difficulties attending communication of the thoughts connected with
the dream. Before investigating the nature of this bond, it will be
advantageous to turn our attention to the more readily intelligible
dreams of the first class where, the manifest and latent content
being identical, the dream work seems to be omitted.</p>
<p>The investigation of these dreams is also advisable from another
standpoint. The dreams of children are of this nature; they have a
meaning, and are not bizarre. This, by the way, is a further
objection to reducing dreams to a dissociation of cerebral activity
in sleep, for why should such a lowering of psychical functions
belong to the nature of sleep in adults, but not in children? We
are, however, fully justified in expecting that the explanation of
psychical processes in children, essentially simplified as they may
be, should serve as an indispensable preparation towards the
psychology of the adult.</p>
<p>I shall therefore cite some examples of dreams which I have
gathered from children. A girl of nineteen months was made to go
without food for a day because she had been sick in the morning,
and, according to nurse, had made herself ill through eating
strawberries. During the night, after her day of fasting, she was
heard calling out her name during sleep, and adding: "Tawberry,
eggs, pap." She is dreaming that she is eating, and selects out of
her menu exactly what she supposes she will not get much of just
now.</p>
<p>The same kind of dream about a forbidden dish was that of a
little boy of twenty-two months. The day before he was told to
offer his uncle a present of a small basket of cherries, of which
the child was, of course, only allowed one to taste. He woke up
with the joyful news: "Hermann eaten up all the cherries."</p>
<p>A girl of three and a half years had made during the day a sea
trip which was too short for her, and she cried when she had to get
out of the boat. The next morning her story was that during the
night she had been on the sea, thus continuing the interrupted
trip.</p>
<p>A boy of five and a half years was not at all pleased with his
party during a walk in the Dachstein region. Whenever a new peak
came into sight he asked if that were the Dachstein, and, finally,
refused to accompany the party to the waterfall. His behavior was
ascribed to fatigue; but a better explanation was forthcoming when
the next morning he told his dream: he had ascended the Dachstein.
Obviously he expected the ascent of the Dachstein to be the object
of the excursion, and was vexed by not getting a glimpse of the
mountain. The dream gave him what the day had withheld. The dream
of a girl of six was similar; her father had cut short the walk
before reaching the promised objective on account of the lateness
of the hour. On the way back she noticed a signpost giving the name
of another place for excursions; her father promised to take her
there also some other day. She greeted her father next day with the
news that she had dreamt that her father had been with her to both
places.</p>
<p>What is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely
satisfy wishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They
are simply and undisguisedly realizations of wishes.</p>
<p>The following child-dream, not quite understandable at first
sight, is nothing else than a wish realized. On account of
poliomyelitis a girl, not quite four years of age, was brought from
the country into town, and remained over night with a childless
aunt in a big—for her, naturally, huge—bed. The next morning she
stated that she had dreamt that the bed was much too small for her,
so that she could find no place in it. To explain this dream as a
wish is easy when we remember that to be "big" is a frequently
expressed wish of all children. The bigness of the bed reminded
Miss Little-Would-be-Big only too forcibly of her smallness. This
nasty situation became righted in her dream, and she grew so big
that the bed now became too small for her.</p>
<p>Even when children's dreams are complicated and polished, their
comprehension as a realization of desire is fairly evident. A boy
of eight dreamt that he was being driven with Achilles in a
war-chariot, guided by Diomedes. The day before he was assiduously
reading about great heroes. It is easy to show that he took these
heroes as his models, and regretted that he was not living in those
days.</p>
<p>From this short collection a further characteristic of the
dreams of children is manifest—their connection with the life of
the day. The desires which are realized in these dreams are left
over from the day or, as a rule, the day previous, and the feeling
has become intently emphasized and fixed during the day thoughts.
Accidental and indifferent matters, or what must appear so to the
child, find no acceptance in the contents of the dream.</p>
<p>Innumerable instances of such dreams of the infantile type can
be found among adults also, but, as mentioned, these are mostly
exactly like the manifest content. Thus, a random selection of
persons will generally respond to thirst at night-time with a dream
about drinking, thus striving to get rid of the sensation and to
let sleep continue. Many persons frequently have these comforting
dreams before waking, just when they are called. They then dream
that they are already up, that they are washing, or already in
school, at the office, etc., where they ought to be at a given
time. The night before an intended journey one not infrequently
dreams that one has already arrived at the destination; before
going to a play or to a party the dream not infrequently
anticipates, in impatience, as it were, the expected pleasure. At
other times the dream expresses the realization of the desire
somewhat indirectly; some connection, some sequel must be known—the
first step towards recognizing the desire. Thus, when a husband
related to me the dream of his young wife, that her monthly period
had begun, I had to bethink myself that the young wife would have
expected a pregnancy if the period had been absent. The dream is
then a sign of pregnancy. Its meaning is that it shows the wish
realized that pregnancy should not occur just yet. Under unusual
and extreme circumstances, these dreams of the infantile type
become very frequent. The leader of a polar expedition tells us,
for instance, that during the wintering amid the ice the crew, with
their monotonous diet and slight rations, dreamt regularly, like
children, of fine meals, of mountains of tobacco, and of home.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that out of some long, complicated and
intricate dream one specially lucid part stands out containing
unmistakably the realization of a desire, but bound up with much
unintelligible matter. On more frequently analyzing the seemingly
more transparent dreams of adults, it is astonishing to discover
that these are rarely as simple as the dreams of children, and that
they cover another meaning beyond that of the realization of a
wish.</p>
<p>It would certainly be a simple and convenient solution of the
riddle if the work of analysis made it at all possible for us to
trace the meaningless and intricate dreams of adults back to the
infantile type, to the realization of some intensely experienced
desire of the day. But there is no warrant for such an expectation.
Their dreams are generally full of the most indifferent and bizarre
matter, and no trace of the realization of the wish is to be found
in their content.</p>
<p>Before leaving these infantile dreams, which are obviously
unrealized desires, we must not fail to mention another chief
characteristic of dreams, one that has been long noticed, and one
which stands out most clearly in this class. I can replace any of
these dreams by a phrase expressing a desire. If the sea trip had
only lasted longer; if I were only washed and dressed; if I had
only been allowed to keep the cherries instead of giving them to my
uncle. But the dream gives something more than the choice, for here
the desire is already realized; its realization is real and actual.
The dream presentations consist chiefly, if not wholly, of scenes
and mainly of visual sense images. Hence a kind of transformation
is not entirely absent in this class of dreams, and this may be
fairly designated as the dream work. An idea merely existing in the
region of possibility is replaced by a vision of its
accomplishment.</p>
