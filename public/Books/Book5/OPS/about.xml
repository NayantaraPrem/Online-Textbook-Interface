<div class="aboutauthor"><strong>About Freud:</strong><br />
<p>Sigmund Freud (born Sigismund Schlomo Freud) May 6, 1856 –
September 23, 1939; was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist
who co-founded the psychoanalytic school of psychology. Freud is
best known for his theories of the unconscious mind, especially
involving the mechanism of repression; his redefinition of sexual
desire as mobile and directed towards a wide variety of objects;
and his therapeutic techniques, especially his understanding of
transference in the therapeutic relationship and the presumed value
of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires. He is
commonly referred to as "the father of psychoanalysis" and his work
has been highly influential-—popularizing such notions as the
unconscious, defense mechanisms, Freudian slips and dream symbolism
— while also making a long-lasting impact on fields as diverse as
literature (Kafka), film, Marxist and feminist theories, literary
criticism, philosophy, and psychology. However, his theories remain
controversial and widely disputed. Source: Wikipedia</p>
