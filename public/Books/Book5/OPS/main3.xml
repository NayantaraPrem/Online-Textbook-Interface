<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter TITANIA, with her train</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TITANIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;<br />
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;<br />
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,<br />
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,<br />
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back<br />
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders<br />
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;<br />
Then to your offices and let me rest.<br /></p>
<p><em>The Fairies sing</em></p>
<p>You spotted snakes with double tongue,<br />
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;<br />
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,<br />
Come not near our fairy queen.<br />
Philomel, with melody<br />
Sing in our sweet lullaby;<br />
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:<br />
Never harm,<br />
Nor spell nor charm,<br />
Come our lovely lady nigh;<br />
So, good night, with lullaby.<br />
Weaving spiders, come not here;<br />
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!<br />
Beetles black, approach not near;<br />
Worm nor snail, do no offence.<br />
Philomel, with melody, &amp; c.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, away! now all is well:<br />
One aloof stand sentinel.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's
eyelids</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OBERON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What thou seest when thou dost wake,<br />
Do it for thy true-love take,<br />
Love and languish for his sake:<br />
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,<br />
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,<br />
In thy eye that shall appear<br />
When thou wakest, it is thy dear:<br />
Wake when some vile thing is near.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;<br />
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:<br />
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,<br />
And tarry for the comfort of the day.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;<br />
For I upon this bank will rest my head.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;<br />
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,<br />
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!<br />
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.<br />
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit<br />
So that but one heart we can make of it;<br />
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;<br />
So then two bosoms and a single troth.<br />
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;<br />
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lysander riddles very prettily:<br />
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,<br />
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.<br />
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy<br />
Lie further off; in human modesty,<br />
Such separation as may well be said<br />
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,<br />
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:<br />
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;<br />
And then end life when I end loyalty!<br />
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!<br /></p>
<p><em>They sleep</em></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PUCK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the forest have I gone.<br />
But Athenian found I none,<br />
On whose eyes I might approve<br />
This flower's force in stirring love.<br />
Night and silence.â€”Who is here?<br />
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:<br />
This is he, my master said,<br />
Despised the Athenian maid;<br />
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,<br />
On the dank and dirty ground.<br />
Pretty soul! she durst not lie<br />
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.<br />
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw<br />
All the power this charm doth owe.<br />
When thou wakest, let love forbid<br />
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:<br />
So awake when I am gone;<br />
For I must now to Oberon.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!<br />
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br />
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;<br />
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.<br />
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:<br />
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.<br />
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;<br />
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:<br />
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius<br />
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.<br />
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<br />
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?<br />
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!<br />
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.<br />
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.<br />
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,<br />
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.<br />
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word<br />
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not say so, Lysander; say not so<br />
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?<br />
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content with Hermia! No; I do repent<br />
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<br />
Not Hermia but Helena I love:<br />
Who will not change a raven for a dove?<br />
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;<br />
And reason says you are the worthier maid.<br />
Things growing are not ripe until their season<br />
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;<br />
And touching now the point of human skill,<br />
Reason becomes the marshal to my will<br />
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook<br />
Love's stories written in love's richest book.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<br />
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<br />
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,<br />
That I did never, no, nor never can,<br />
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,<br />
But you must flout my insufficiency?<br />
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,<br />
In such disdainful manner me to woo.<br />
But fare you well: perforce I must confess<br />
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<br />
O, that a lady, of one man refused.<br />
Should of another therefore be abused!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LYSANDER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:<br />
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!<br />
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br />
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,<br />
Or as tie heresies that men do leave<br />
Are hated most of those they did deceive,<br />
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<br />
Of all be hated, but the most of me!<br />
And, all my powers, address your love and might<br />
To honour Helen and to be her knight!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERMIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best<br />
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!<br />
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!<br />
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:<br />
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,<br />
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.<br />
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!<br />
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?<br />
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;<br />
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.<br />
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh<br />
Either death or you I'll find immediately.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
