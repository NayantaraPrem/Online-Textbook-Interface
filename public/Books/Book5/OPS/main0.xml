<div class="text">
<p>The medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should
not be considered as the proper material for wild experiments.</p>
<p>Conservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy
minds, loath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.</p>
<p>Remember the scornful reception which first was accorded to
Freud's discoveries in the domain of the unconscious.</p>
<p>When after years of patient observations, he finally decided to
appear before medical bodies to tell them modestly of some facts
which always recurred in his dream and his patients' dreams, he was
first laughed at and then avoided as a crank.</p>
<p>The words "dream interpretation" were and still are indeed
fraught with unpleasant, unscientific associations. They remind one
of all sorts of childish, superstitious notions, which make up the
thread and woof of dream books, read by none but the ignorant and
the primitive.</p>
<p>The wealth of detail, the infinite care never to let anything
pass unexplained, with which he presented to the public the result
of his investigations, are impressing more and more serious-minded
scientists, but the examination of his evidential data demands
arduous work and presupposes an absolutely open mind.</p>
<p>This is why we still encounter men, totally unfamiliar with
Freud's writings, men who were not even interested enough in the
subject to attempt an interpretation of their dreams or their
patients' dreams, deriding Freud's theories and combatting them
with the help of statements which he never made.</p>
<p>Some of them, like Professor Boris Sidis, reach at times
conclusions which are strangely similar to Freud's, but in their
ignorance of psychoanalytic literature, they fail to credit Freud
for observations antedating theirs.</p>
<p>Besides those who sneer at dream study, because they have never
looked into the subject, there are those who do not dare to face
the facts revealed by dream study. Dreams tell us many an
unpleasant biological truth about ourselves and only very free
minds can thrive on such a diet. Self-deception is a plant which
withers fast in the pellucid atmosphere of dream investigation.</p>
<p>The weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not
anxious to turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners
of their psychology.</p>
<p>Freud's theories are anything but theoretical.</p>
<p>He was moved by the fact that there always seemed to be a close
connection between his patients' dreams and their mental
abnormalities, to collect thousands of dreams and to compare them
with the case histories in his possession.</p>
<p>He did not start out with a preconceived bias, hoping to find
evidence which might support his views. He looked at facts a
thousand times "until they began to tell him something."</p>
<p>His attitude toward dream study was, in other words, that of a
statistician who does not know, and has no means of foreseeing,
what conclusions will be forced on him by the information he is
gathering, but who is fully prepared to accept those unavoidable
conclusions.</p>
<p>This was indeed a novel way in psychology. Psychologists had
always been wont to build, in what Bleuler calls "autistic ways,"
that is through methods in no wise supported by evidence, some
attractive hypothesis, which sprung from their brain, like Minerva
from Jove's brain, fully armed.</p>
<p>After which, they would stretch upon that unyielding frame the
hide of a reality which they had previously killed.</p>
<p>It is only to minds suffering from the same distortions, to
minds also autistically inclined, that those empty, artificial
structures appear acceptable molds for philosophic thinking.</p>
<p>The pragmatic view that "truth is what works" had not been as
yet expressed when Freud published his revolutionary views on the
psychology of dreams.</p>
<p>Five facts of first magnitude were made obvious to the world by
his interpretation of dreams.</p>
<p>First of all, Freud pointed out a constant connection between
some part of every dream and some detail of the dreamer's life
during the previous waking state. This positively establishes a
relation between sleeping states and waking states and disposes of
the widely prevalent view that dreams are purely nonsensical
phenomena coming from nowhere and leading nowhere.</p>
<p>Secondly, Freud, after studying the dreamer's life and modes of
thought, after noting down all his mannerisms and the apparently
insignificant details of his conduct which reveal his secret
thoughts, came to the conclusion that there was in every dream the
attempted or successful gratification of some wish, conscious or
unconscious.</p>
<p>Thirdly, he proved that many of our dream visions are
symbolical, which causes us to consider them as absurd and
unintelligible; the universality of those symbols, however, makes
them very transparent to the trained observer.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Freud showed that sexual desires play an enormous part
in our unconscious, a part which puritanical hypocrisy has always
tried to minimize, if not to ignore entirely.</p>
<p>Finally, Freud established a direct connection between dreams
and insanity, between the symbolic visions of our sleep and the
symbolic actions of the mentally deranged.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many other observations which Freud made
while dissecting the dreams of his patients, but not all of them
present as much interest as the foregoing nor were they as
revolutionary or likely to wield as much influence on modern
psychiatry.</p>
<p>Other explorers have struck the path blazed by Freud and leading
into man's unconscious. Jung of Zurich, Adler of Vienna and Kempf
of Washington, D.C., have made to the study of the unconscious,
contributions which have brought that study into fields which Freud
himself never dreamt of invading.</p>
<p>One fact which cannot be too emphatically stated, however, is
that but for Freud's wishfulfillment theory of dreams, neither
Jung's "energic theory," nor Adler's theory of "organ inferiority
and compensation," nor Kempf's "dynamic mechanism" might have been
formulated.</p>
<p>Freud is the father of modern abnormal psychology and he
established the psychoanalytical point of view. No one who is not
well grounded in Freudian lore can hope to achieve any work of
value in the field of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let no one repeat the absurd assertion that
Freudism is a sort of religion bounded with dogmas and requiring an
act of faith. Freudism as such was merely a stage in the
development of psychoanalysis, a stage out of which all but a few
bigoted camp followers, totally lacking in originality, have
evolved. Thousands of stones have been added to the structure
erected by the Viennese physician and many more will be added in
the course of time.</p>
<p>But the new additions to that structure would collapse like a
house of cards but for the original foundations which are as
indestructible as Harvey's statement as to the circulation of the
blood.</p>
<p>Regardless of whatever additions or changes have been made to
the original structure, the analytic point of view remains
unchanged.</p>
<p>That point of view is not only revolutionising all the methods
of diagnosis and treatment of mental derangements, but compelling
the intelligent, up-to-date physician to revise entirely his
attitude to almost every kind of disease.</p>
<p>The insane are no longer absurd and pitiable people, to be
herded in asylums till nature either cures them or relieves them,
through death, of their misery. The insane who have not been made
so by actual injury to their brain or nervous system, are the
victims of unconscious forces which cause them to do abnormally
things which they might be helped to do normally.</p>
<p>Insight into one's psychology is replacing victoriously
sedatives and rest cures.</p>
<p>Physicians dealing with "purely" physical cases have begun to
take into serious consideration the "mental" factors which have
predisposed a patient to certain ailments.</p>
<p>Freud's views have also made a revision of all ethical and
social values unavoidable and have thrown an unexpected flood of
light upon literary and artistic accomplishment.</p>
<p>But the Freudian point of view, or more broadly speaking, the
psychoanalytic point of view, shall ever remain a puzzle to those
who, from laziness or indifference, refuse to survey with the great
Viennese the field over which he carefully groped his way. We shall
never be convinced until we repeat under his guidance all his
laboratory experiments.</p>
<p>We must follow him through the thickets of the unconscious,
through the land which had never been charted because academic
philosophers, following the line of least effort, had decided a
priori that it could not be charted.</p>
<p>Ancient geographers, when exhausting their store of information
about distant lands, yielded to an unscientific craving for romance
and, without any evidence to support their day dreams, filled the
blank spaces left on their maps by unexplored tracts with amusing
inserts such as "Here there are lions."</p>
<p>Thanks to Freud's interpretation of dreams the "royal road" into
the unconscious is now open to all explorers. They shall not find
lions, they shall find man himself, and the record of all his life
and of his struggle with reality.</p>
<p>And it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by
his dreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully.
For as Freud said to Putnam: "We are what we are because we have
been what we have been."</p>
<p>Not a few serious-minded students, however, have been
discouraged from attempting a study of Freud's dream
psychology.</p>
<p>The book in which he originally offered to the world his
interpretation of dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to
be pondered over by scientists at their leisure, not to be
assimilated in a few hours by the average alert reader. In those
days, Freud could not leave out any detail likely to make his
extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable to those willing to
sift data.</p>
<p>Freud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which
the reading of his magnum opus imposed upon those who have not been
prepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and
he abstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute
the essential of his discoveries.</p>
<p>The publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting
to the reading public the gist of Freud's psychology in the
master's own words, and in a form which shall neither discourage
beginners, nor appear too elementary to those who are more advanced
in psychoanalytic study.</p>
<p>Dream psychology is the key to Freud's works and to all modern
psychology. With a simple, compact manual such as Dream Psychology
there shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most
revolutionary psychological system of modern times.</p>
