<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before
him</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How goes the night, boy?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLEANCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And she goes down at twelve.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FLEANCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take't, 'tis later, sir.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;<br />
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.<br />
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,<br />
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,<br />
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature<br />
Gives way to in repose!<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch</em></p>
<p>Give me my sword.<br />
Who's there?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:<br />
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and<br />
Sent forth great largess to your offices.<br />
This diamond he greets your wife withal,<br />
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up<br />
In measureless content.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being unprepared,<br />
Our will became the servant to defect;<br />
Which else should free have wrought.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All's well.<br />
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:<br />
To you they have show'd some truth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think not of them:<br />
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,<br />
We would spend it in some words upon that business,<br />
If you would grant the time.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At your kind'st leisure.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,<br />
It shall make honour for you.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I lose none<br />
In seeking to augment it, but still keep<br />
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,<br />
I shall be counsell'd.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good repose the while!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BANQUO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, sir: the like to you!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,<br />
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<p>Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br />
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<br />
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<br />
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<br />
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but<br />
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<br />
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?<br />
I see thee yet, in form as palpable<br />
As this which now I draw.<br />
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;<br />
And such an instrument I was to use.<br />
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,<br />
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,<br />
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,<br />
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:<br />
It is the bloody business which informs<br />
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld<br />
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse<br />
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates<br />
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,<br />
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,<br />
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.<br />
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design<br />
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,<br />
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br />
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,<br />
And take the present horror from the time,<br />
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:<br />
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.<br /></p>
<p><em>A bell rings</em></p>
<p>I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.<br />
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell<br />
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
