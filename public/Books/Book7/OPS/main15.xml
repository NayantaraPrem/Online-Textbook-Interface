<blockquote>
<p><em>Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HECATE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have I not reason, beldams as you are,<br />
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare<br />
To trade and traffic with Macbeth<br />
In riddles and affairs of death;<br />
And I, the mistress of your charms,<br />
The close contriver of all harms,<br />
Was never call'd to bear my part,<br />
Or show the glory of our art?<br />
And, which is worse, all you have done<br />
Hath been but for a wayward son,<br />
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,<br />
Loves for his own ends, not for you.<br />
But make amends now: get you gone,<br />
And at the pit of Acheron<br />
Meet me i' the morning: thither he<br />
Will come to know his destiny:<br />
Your vessels and your spells provide,<br />
Your charms and every thing beside.<br />
I am for the air; this night I'll spend<br />
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:<br />
Great business must be wrought ere noon:<br />
Upon the corner of the moon<br />
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;<br />
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:<br />
And that distill'd by magic sleights<br />
Shall raise such artificial sprites<br />
As by the strength of their illusion<br />
Shall draw him on to his confusion:<br />
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear<br />
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:<br />
And you all know, security<br />
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.<br /></p>
<p><em>Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' &amp;
c</em></p>
<p>Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,<br />
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Witch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
