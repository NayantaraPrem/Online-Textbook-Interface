<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'They met me in the day of success: and I have<br />
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in<br />
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire<br />
to question them further, they made themselves air,<br />
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in<br />
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who<br />
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,<br />
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred<br />
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that<br />
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver<br />
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou<br />
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being<br />
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it<br />
to thy heart, and farewell.'<br />
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be<br />
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;<br />
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness<br />
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;<br />
Art not without ambition, but without<br />
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,<br />
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,<br />
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,<br />
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;<br />
And that which rather thou dost fear to do<br />
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,<br />
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;<br />
And chastise with the valour of my tongue<br />
All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br />
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<br />
To have thee crown'd withal.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<p>What is your tidings?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king comes here to-night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou'rt mad to say it:<br />
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,<br />
Would have inform'd for preparation.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:<br />
One of my fellows had the speed of him,<br />
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more<br />
Than would make up his message.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give him tending;<br />
He brings great news.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Messenger</em></p>
<p>The raven himself is hoarse<br />
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan<br />
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits<br />
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,<br />
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<br />
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;<br />
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,<br />
That no compunctious visitings of nature<br />
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between<br />
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,<br />
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,<br />
Wherever in your sightless substances<br />
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,<br />
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,<br />
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,<br />
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,<br />
To cry 'Hold, hold!'<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<p>Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!<br />
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!<br />
Thy letters have transported me beyond<br />
This ignorant present, and I feel now<br />
The future in the instant.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dearest love,<br />
Duncan comes here to-night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when goes hence?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To-morrow, as he purposes.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, never<br />
Shall sun that morrow see!<br />
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men<br />
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,<br />
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,<br />
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,<br />
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming<br />
Must be provided for: and you shall put<br />
This night's great business into my dispatch;<br />
Which shall to all our nights and days to come<br />
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will speak further.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only look up clear;<br />
To alter favour ever is to fear:<br />
Leave all the rest to me.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
