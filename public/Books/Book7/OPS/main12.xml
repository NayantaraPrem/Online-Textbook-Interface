<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Banquo gone from court?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Servant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say to the king, I would attend his leisure<br />
For a few words.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Servant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Madam, I will.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nought's had, all's spent,<br />
Where our desire is got without content:<br />
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy<br />
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<p>How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,<br />
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,<br />
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died<br />
With them they think on? Things without all remedy<br />
Should be without regard: what's done is done.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:<br />
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice<br />
Remains in danger of her former tooth.<br />
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the<br />
worlds suffer,<br />
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep<br />
In the affliction of these terrible dreams<br />
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,<br />
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<br />
Than on the torture of the mind to lie<br />
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<br />
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;<br />
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,<br />
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,<br />
Can touch him further.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come on;<br />
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;<br />
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:<br />
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;<br />
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:<br />
Unsafe the while, that we<br />
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,<br />
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,<br />
Disguising what they are.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must leave this.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!<br />
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But in them nature's copy's not eterne.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's comfort yet; they are assailable;<br />
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown<br />
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons<br />
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums<br />
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done<br />
A deed of dreadful note.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's to be done?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,<br />
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,<br />
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;<br />
And with thy bloody and invisible hand<br />
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond<br />
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow<br />
Makes wing to the rooky wood:<br />
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;<br />
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.<br />
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;<br />
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.<br />
So, prithee, go with me.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
