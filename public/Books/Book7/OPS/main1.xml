<blockquote>
<p><em>Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX,
with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What bloody man is that? He can report,<br />
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt<br />
The newest state.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the sergeant<br />
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought<br />
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!<br />
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil<br />
As thou didst leave it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sergeant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doubtful it stood;<br />
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together<br />
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald—<br />
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<br />
The multiplying villanies of nature<br />
Do swarm upon him—from the western isles<br />
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<br />
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<br />
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:<br />
For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name—<br />
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,<br />
Which smoked with bloody execution,<br />
Like valour's minion carved out his passage<br />
Till he faced the slave;<br />
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<br />
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,<br />
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sergeant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection<br />
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,<br />
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come<br />
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:<br />
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd<br />
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<br />
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,<br />
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men<br />
Began a fresh assault.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dismay'd not this<br />
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sergeant</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes;<br />
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<br />
If I say sooth, I must report they were<br />
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they<br />
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<br />
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<br />
Or memorise another Golgotha,<br />
I cannot tell.<br />
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;<br />
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit Sergeant, attended</em></p>
<p>Who comes here?<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worthy thane of Ross.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LENNOX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look<br />
That seems to speak things strange.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God save the king!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Fife, great king;<br />
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky<br />
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,<br />
With terrible numbers,<br />
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor<br />
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;<br />
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,<br />
Confronted him with self-comparisons,<br />
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.<br />
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,<br />
The victory fell on us.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great happiness!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That now<br />
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:<br />
Nor would we deign him burial of his men<br />
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch<br />
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive<br />
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,<br />
And with his former title greet Macbeth.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll see it done.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DUNCAN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
