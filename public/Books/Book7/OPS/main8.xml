<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;<br />
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.<br />
Hark! Peace!<br />
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,<br />
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:<br />
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms<br />
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd<br />
their possets,<br />
That death and nature do contend about them,<br />
Whether they live or die.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Within] Who's there? what, ho!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,<br />
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed<br />
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;<br />
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled<br />
My father as he slept, I had done't.<br /></p>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<p>My husband!<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.<br />
Did not you speak?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I descended?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hark!<br />
Who lies i' the second chamber?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donalbain.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a sorry sight.<br /></p>
<p><em>Looking on his hands</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried<br />
'Murder!'<br />
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:<br />
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them<br />
Again to sleep.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two lodged together.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;<br />
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.<br />
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'<br />
When they did say 'God bless us!'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider it not so deeply.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?<br />
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'<br />
Stuck in my throat.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These deeds must not be thought<br />
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!<br />
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,<br />
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,<br />
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,<br />
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,<br />
Chief nourisher in life's feast,â€”<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:<br />
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor<br />
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,<br />
You do unbend your noble strength, to think<br />
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,<br />
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.<br />
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?<br />
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear<br />
The sleepy grooms with blood.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll go no more:<br />
I am afraid to think what I have done;<br />
Look on't again I dare not.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infirm of purpose!<br />
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead<br />
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood<br />
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,<br />
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;<br />
For it must seem their guilt.<br /></p>
<p><em>Exit. Knocking within</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whence is that knocking?<br />
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?<br />
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.<br />
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood<br />
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather<br />
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,<br />
Making the green one red.<br /></p>
<p><em>Re-enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hands are of your colour; but I shame<br />
To wear a heart so white.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>I hear a knocking<br />
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;<br />
A little water clears us of this deed:<br />
How easy is it, then! Your constancy<br />
Hath left you unattended.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Hark! more knocking.<br />
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,<br />
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost<br />
So poorly in your thoughts.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MACBETH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.<br /></p>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<p>Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!<br /></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
